132820,"In our country, we often say “Allah ghalib (Allah’s decree always prevails)”, and that may be in the context of an excuse for not doing something. So for example, you might say to a person: Why did you not do such and such? And he will answer by saying: Allah ghalib. Or you may say: Why did you not keep your promise? And he will answer by saying: Allah ghalib. What is the ruling on saying this, especially in that context?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah’s decree always prevails, though most people do not realize}\xa0[Yusuf 12:21].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThat is, if Allah wants something to happen, it cannot be stopped, prevented or opposed; rather He is the One Whose decree always prevails over everything else.\nSa`id ibn Jubayr said: That is, He does whatever He wills. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/378).\nShaykh as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThat is, His decree is always executed and nothing can cancel it out or oppose it, {though most people do not realize}. That is why they try to take measures to overcome the universal decree of Allah, but they are too weak and helpless to achieve that. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa`di, p. 395)\nThis is like the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: He is Dominant over His slaves} [al-An`am 6:18], and similar verses.\nSo if someone says “Allah ghalib (Allah’s decree always prevails)” intending to ascribe to Allah overwhelming power, might, glory and subjugation, then he has described Allah as He deserves.\nBut if his intention when saying that is to justify himself when falling short or committing sin, then he is misusing the concept of the divine decree as justification for that, because the divine decree can only be referred to when calamity befalls a person, and cannot be used to justify faults and shortcomings.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is obligatory to believe in the divine decree, but it is not permissible to use it as justification for going against the commands, prohibitions, promise and warning of Allah. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 1/155)\nHe also said:\nAs using the divine decree as justification in such a manner is wrong according to people’s common sense and reason, no nation ever used it as justification (for sins and shortcomings). No interest could ever be achieved on the basis of this argument, in this world or the hereafter. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 1/167)\nShaykh as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNo wise person accepts the use of the divine decree as justification (for sins and shortcomings), even if he sometimes refers to it as justification for his situation, he would not persist in doing that. From an Islamic point of view, Allah has stated that using the divine decree as justification is wrong, and He did not mention that in the Quran except as something that was said by the polytheists who disbelieved in His messengers. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa`di, 1/763)\nMuslim (2664) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say ‘If only I had done (such and such), then such and such would have happened,’ rather say: ‘It is the decree of Allah and what He wills, He does,’ for ‘if only’ opens the door to the work of the Shaytan.”\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHere the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructs the believer, when calamity befalls him, to connect his calamity to the divine decree and not dwell on the past; rather he should realize that what has befallen him could not have missed him, and what has missed him could not have befallen him. So he should think of the divine decree at the time of calamity and seek forgiveness from his shortcomings. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 8/77)\nHe also said:\nMan is not enjoined to think of the divine decree when he is enjoined to do what Allah has commanded him to do; rather he is enjoined to think of the divine decree when calamities befall him that he has no way to avoid. So whatever troubles befall you as a result of the actions of human beings or otherwise, you should show patience, accept it and surrender your affairs to Allah. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 8/178)\nIt may be said to this person: As Allah’s decree always prevails, Allah, may He be exalted, is also a fair judge, and His is the creation and the command. He has commanded us to obey Him and has forbidden us to disobey Him, so referring to His decree and citing it as an excuse for going against His religion is the way of the polytheists, as Allah, may He be exalted, has told us, as He says:\n{When they do something shameful, they say: We found our fathers doing this and Allah has enjoined it upon us. Say: Verily, Allah does not enjoin that which is shameful. Would you attribute to Allah something of which you have no knowledge?\nSay [O Muhammad]: My Lord has enjoined the doing of what is right; direct your worship only to Him whenever you pray, and call upon Him with sincere devotion to Him alone.

103432,"What is your opinion about a person who falsely divorces his wife, i.e. formally having the divorce contract, without saying the word of talaq actually to her? This enables him to marry a European woman in order to get a residency. Then he will divorce the European woman and return his first wife to him afterwards. What is the ruling on this matter?","['Praise be to Allah.The Sacred Nature of Marriage in Islam\nMarriage is a serious covenant and it is one of the most important rulings of Shari`ah, by means of which intimacy becomes permissible and rights such as the Mahr (dowry) and inheritance are proven, and children are attributed to their father, and other rulings.\nToying with Marriage and Divorce Contracts is Forbidden\nBy means of divorce, a woman becomes forbidden for her husband and is deprived of inheritance, and she becomes permissible for other men to marry, subject to well-known conditions.\nOur aim in explaining all this is to alert the Muslims to the necessity of not using these two contracts in ways other than that which has been prescribed by Allah, and not using them as tricks.\nWe have seen – unfortunately – men who will marry a woman not so that the intimacy with her which was forbidden becomes permissible, and not so as to form a family with her – as is the aim of the Shar`i contract – but so as to attain some worldly purpose, such as registering land, or getting a licence to open a business, or to get residency, or to enable the woman to travel outside her country.\nIn none of these cases is the man a husband or the woman a wife in the real sense, rather he is a husband on paper only! It is not more than ink on paper. This is a kind of toying with the rulings of Shari`ah. It is not permissible to do it or to take part in it, and it is essential to try to stop it when the aim is to achieve some prohibited purpose, such as the one who does that in order to get residency in a non-Muslim country.\nThe same may be said with regard to divorce. It is a Shar`i ruling and it is not permissible for anyone to take it lightly or to toy with its rulings. They call that a divorce on paper.\nThese people should all realise that they are sinning by doing this. Allah has not prescribed marriage and divorce so that the wife might be a name on the contract with no rulings and rights. They should realise that the rulings come into effect merely by virtue of the contract being done, if the conditions and essential parts of it are fulfilled, and that if any of these are missing it is invalid, and that divorce from the husband takes place if the words are merely uttered. There is no such thing in Shari`ah as marriage on paper and divorce on paper. The sin is further compounded if it is done in order to do something that is prohibited in the first place, such as one who uses it to avoid giving people their rights or paying debts to them, or if a woman uses it to get help given to divorcees by a state or institution, or so that she can live in a non-Muslim state where it is not permissible for her to reside, and other invalid, forbidden aims.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Lawgiver forbids treating the Verses (Laws) of Allah as a jest [Al-Baqarah 2:231] and forbids a man to speak of the Verses of Allah which are binding contracts except in a serious manner as they are meant to be. Hence it is forbidden to take them lightly and or to marry a divorced woman in order to divorce her so that it will be permissible for her to go back to her first husband. This is indicated by the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): {And treat not the Verses (Laws) of Allah as a jest} [Al-Baqarah 2:231], and by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “What is the matter with people who toy with the sacred limits of Allah and make a mockery of His verses (laws), (and say), I divorce you, I take you back, I divorce you, I take you back?” It should be understood that toying with them is prohibited. (End quote from Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 6/65)\nBased on this, if a man marries a woman who is permissible for him, and it is done in accordance with the conditions prescribed in Shari`ah, with the essential parts being fulfilled and in the absence of any impediments, then it is a valid marriage with all that that implies.\nIf a man divorces his wife verbally, it counts as a divorce, even if he does not intend it as such.\nAs for a written divorce that is not uttered out loud, that is subject to further discussion as explained in the answer to question no.\xa072291.\nMarriage Solely for Residency: A Forbidden Act\nMarrying that European woman for the purpose of obtaining residency and then divorcing her is a forbidden action. We have quoted the Fatwa of Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) prohibiting such actions in the answer to question no.\xa02886.\nThis applies if he marries her without fulfilling the conditions of marriage, such as if he marries her without a guardian, or if there is any impediment to the validity of the marriage, such as if she is an adulteress who has not repented, or she is not one of the people of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian), in which case marriage to her is prohibited and is invalid.\nIf he marries her in a marriage that fulfils all the necessary parts and\xa0conditions, and is free of any impediments, then his marriage is valid with all that that implies, but his intention is forbidden.\nDeception and Trickery in Marriage Are Major Sins\nThese reprehensible actions of obtaining a divorce paper for the first wife and marrying another woman for the purpose of obtaining residency, then divorcing her, include two other things that are prohibited:\n\nTrickery, lying and giving false witness, because it is deceiving the state and tricking it in order to obtain nationality, which is prohibited.\nHe wants to do the divorce and marriage on paper in order to get residency in a non-Muslim country, but in our religion it is forbidden to settle among the disbelievers unnecessarily, because of the great danger that this poses to one’s religious commitment and morals, and to the individual and the family.\n\nIt was narrated from Jarir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I disavow any Muslim who settles among the polytheists.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2645; and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nWhat we advise our brothers to do is to fear Allah, may He be Exalted, with regard to Shar`i contracts and not to use them as means to worldly ends, and to refrain altogether if the purposes are prohibited. They should fear Allah with regard to their wives and children, and think about the great hardship that their actions may lead to, or the deprivation of rights and other negative consequences that may result from doing these contracts in this corrupt manner.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 22728, 116994, 113867, 364.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103432/is-sham-marriage-allowed-in-islam%C2%A0
131627,"Whilst reading about religious topics, I came across this sentence: “The grave will squeeze its occupant; if anyone were to be spared from that, Sa`d ibn Mu`adh would have been spared from it.” According to another report: “This is the one at whose death the Throne shook, the gates of heaven were opened for him and seventy thousand of the angels attended his funeral. He was squeezed once, then released.” Does this mean that Sa`d ibn Mu`adh was the only one among humanity who was spared from the squeezing of the grave? In other words, is the squeezing of the grave inevitable for every Muslim, even if he took measures to be spared from the punishment of the grave?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe squeezing of the grave is the first thing that the deceased will experience in the realm of al-barzakh. This is affirmed in clear, authentic reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), including the following:\n-1-\nIt was narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“The grave will squeeze its occupant once, and if anyone were to be spared from it, Sa`d ibn Mu`adh would have been spared from it.”\nNarrated by Ahmad, 6/55, 98. Al-`Iraqi said in Takhrij al-Ihya, 5/259: Its isnad is good (jayyid). Adh-Dhahabi said in as-Siyar, 1/291: Its isnad is reliable. Al-Albani said in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah, 1695: To sum up, when all its isnads and corroborating reports are taken into account, the hadith is undoubtedly authentic. (End quote).\nThe commentators on Musnad Ahmad classed it as authentic (Mu’sasat ar-Risalah edn., 40/327)\n-2-\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding Sa`d ibn Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) when he died:\n“This is the one at whose death the Throne shook, the gates of heaven were opened for him and seventy thousand of the angels attended his funeral. He was squeezed once, then released.”\nNarrated by an-Nasa’i in as-Sunan, 2055, 4/100. He said nothing about its isnad, and included it in a chapter entitled The squeezing and pressure of the grave. Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih an-Nasa’i.\n-3-\nIt was narrated from Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) that a child was buried, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“If anyone was to be spared from the squeezing of the grave, this child would be spared.”\nNarrated by at-Tabarani in al-Mu`jam al-Kabir, 4/121. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar classed a similar report as authentic in al-Matalib al-‘Aliyah, 13/44. Al-Haythami classed it as authentic in Majma` az-Zawa’id, 3/47. Al-Albani classed it as authentic in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah, no. 2164.\nIn at-Tadhkirah fi Ahwal al-Mawta wa Umur al-Akhirah, p. 323, under the chapter heading: What was narrated concerning the grave squeezing its occupant even if he was righteous, al-Qurtubi quoted other texts on this topic, but most of them are unreliable and odd.\nSimilarly, in al-Mawdu`at, 3/231, Ibn al-Jawzi narrated many of these reports under the chapter heading, The squeezing of the grave. But what we have mentioned of authentic reports is sufficient, in sha Allah.\nSecondly:\nThe scholars differed as to whether the believer will be subjected to the squeezing of the grave, and in what state he will be at that time. There are two views:\nThe first view:\nThe squeezing of the grave will happen to every believer and it will be intense, but the righteous believer will be released quickly and his grave will be made spacious for him, so this torment will not last for a long time. As for the evildoer, the squeezing will be intense in his case and the constriction of his grave will last longer, commensurate with his sin and disobedience.\nAbu’l-Qasim as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNo one, whether he was righteous or an evildoer, will be spared from the squeezing of the grave, but the difference between the Muslim and the disbeliever in this regard is how long the squeezing will last. It will last for a long time in the case of the disbeliever, whereas for the believer, this squeezing will happen when he is first placed in his grave, then his grave will become spacious again. (End quote)\nAl-Hakim at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe reason for this squeezing is that there is no one who did not commit sin, so this squeezing will be like a punishment for his sin, then the Mercy of Allah will save him from it. (End quote from Hashiyat as-Suyuti ‘ala Sunan an-Nasa’i, 3/292. Ar-Ramli quoted it in his Fatawa, 4/210)\nThe second view: The squeezing of the grave will happen to righteous Muslims, but it will be a gentle and compassionate squeezing, with no pain or suffering. As for the sinful Muslims, the squeezing will be intense in their case, by way of wrath, commensurate with their sins and bad deeds.\nIt was narrated that Muhammad at-Taymi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe used to say that the squeezing of the grave happens because the earth is like their mother and from it they were created, then they were away from it for a long time. So when its children return to it, it embraces them like a compassionate mother whose children were away from her, then they returned to her. Whoever was obedient to Allah, it will squeeze him with gentleness and kindness, but whoever was disobedient to Allah, it will squeeze him with force, because it is angry with him.\nAs-Suyuti narrated it in Hashiyat as-Suyuti ‘ala Sunan an-Nasa’i, 3/292, from the report of Ibn Abi Dunya. He [as-Suyuti] also quoted it in Bushra al-Ka’ib bi Liqa’ al-Habib, p. 5, under the chapter heading: The squeezing of the earth will be gentle for the believer.\nA marfu` hadith regarding this matter was narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), in which she said: O Messenger of Allah, yesterday you told me about the voices of Munkar and Nakir and the squeezing of the grave, and it upset me greatly.\nHe said: “O `A’ishah, the voices of Munkar and Nakir in the ears of the believers are like antimony in the eye, and the squeezing of the grave for the believer is like the compassionate embrace of a mother whose child complains of a headache, so she presses his head gently. But, O `A’ishah, woe to those who doubt Allah, for they will be squeezed in their graves like an egg on a rock.”\nNarrated by al-Bayhaqi in Ithbat `Adhab al-Qabr, p. 85, no. 116, and by ad-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, no. 3776. Its isnad includes al-Hasan ibn Abi Ja`far and `Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad`an, both of whom are unreliable, so it is an unreliable hadith. Some of them attributed it to Ibn Mandah and Ibn an-Najjar, but I have not come across it.\nAl-Hafiz adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis squeezing has nothing to do with the torment of the grave; rather it is something that the believer will feel, just as a person feels the pain of losing his child or his close friend in this world, and as he feels pain when he is sick, pain when his soul is taken, pain when he is being questioned and tested in his grave, pain when hearing his family weep for him, pain when being resurrected from his grave, pain and horror in the place of standing, pain when passing over hell, and so on. He may suffer from all of these frightening things, but they are not the torment of the grave or the torment of hell at all. Rather Allah will alleviate some or all of that for the righteous person, but the believer will have no rest until he meets his Lord. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Day of Regret}\n[Maryam 19:39]\n{And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Approaching Day, when hearts will be at the throats}\n[Ghafir 40:18].\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to forgive us and care for us. Yet despite all these difficult experiences, Sa`d ibn Mu`adh is one of those who we know to be one of the people of Paradise, and we know that he is one of the highest in status of the martyrs (may Allah be pleased with them). It is as if you think that the victorious one will not go through any trials in this world or the hereafter, and he will not go through any terror, pain or fear! Ask your Lord for well-being, and ask Him to gather us with the group in which Sa`d will be. (End quote from A`lam an-Nubala’, 1/290-292)\nShaykh an-Nafrawi al-Maliki said:\nWith regard to the squeezing of the grave, it is inevitable, but it will vary according to the differences in people’s status. (End quote from al-Fawakih ad-Dawani, 2/688)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis hadith – the hadith “The grave squeezed Sa`d once” – is well known to the scholars. Assuming it is authentic, the earth’s squeezing of the believer will be an embrace of mercy and compassion, like a mother embracing her child. As for its squeezing of the disbeliever, it will be a squeezing of pain and torment – Allah forbid. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that when a person is buried, two angels come to him and ask him about three fundamental matters: Who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is your prophet? The believer says: My Lord is Allah, my religion is Islam and my prophet is Muhammad. I ask Allah to make this my answer and your answer. As for the hypocrite or the apostate – may Allah protect us and you from that – he will say: Oh, oh, I do not know; I heard the people say something so I said it too. Then the grave will squeeze him until his ribs interlock – Allah forbid – due to the severity of the squeezing. So there is a difference between the way in which the earth will squeeze the disbeliever or apostate and the way in which it will squeeze the believer. (End quote from Liqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh, no. 161, question no. 17).\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that the first view is the more likely to be correct regarding this issue, because of what is clearly indicated by the hadith, and that no one among the believers, let alone others, will be spared from the squeezing of the grave. This is indicative of how difficult this squeezing will be, and that it will cause pain to the one who is squeezed in his grave, even though people will vary in that, each according to his deeds and his situation. Because of that, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) described the squeezing of the grave as one of the means of attaining forgiveness of sins. He said: … The eighth means is what will happen in the grave of testing, squeezing and terror, for these are things that bring about expiation of sins. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 7/500).\nHowever, the hadith mentioned in the question does not indicate that Sa`d is the only one who was spared from the squeezing of the grave, as the questioner thinks. Rather it says that Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him) was not spared from the squeezing of the grave, although he was the most deserving of being spared, if anyone was to be spared.\nSee also the answer to question no. 71175.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131627/will-anyone-be-spared-from-the-squeezing-in-the-grave
70530,Is it possible when doing Wudu to wipe a small part of the head at the back and not at the front?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is wiping the hair mandatory in Wudu?\nThe Muslims unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to wipe the head when doing Wudu, because Allah Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! When you intend to offer the prayer, wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles.}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:6]\nIs Wiping Part of the Head Enough in Wudu?\nThe jurists agreed that it is best to wipe the entire head, but they differed as to whether doing so is obligatory or not.\xa0The Malikis and Hanbalis are of the view that it is obligatory to wipe the entire head. The Hanafis and Shafi`is are of the view that it is sufficient to wipe part of the head.\nThe Malikis and Hanbalis quoted a number of things as evidence:\n\nAllah Says (interpretation of the meaning): {rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads} which includes the entire head.\n\nThis verse – “rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads” – refers to the entire head and it is like the phrase in which Allah says concerning Tayammum (interpretation of the meaning): {then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:6] The entire face must be wiped in Tayammum, and the same applies to the head in this case.\xa0(End quote from Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 21/125)\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe jurists differed concerning the one who wipes part of the head. Malik said: What must be done is to wipe the entire head, and if he omits part of it then he is like one who fails to wash part of his face. This is the well-known view in the Madhhab of Malik, and it is also the view of Ibn `Uliyyah. Ibn `Uliyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah commanded us to wipe the head in Wudu as He commanded us to wipe the face in Tayammum and to wash it in Wudu. They unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to wash only part of the face in Wudu or to wipe only part of it in Tayammum. The same applies to wiping the head. (End quote from At-Tamhid, 20/114)\n\nThey quoted as evidence the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for there is a proven report of him wiping only part of his head.\n\nThe Hanafis and Shafi`is also quoted evidence, including the following:\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): {rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads [wa’msahu bi ru’usikum]} – the Ba’ (before the word ru’usikum (heads)) indicates something partial, as if He were saying: “Wash part of your heads.”\n\nMy response to that is to note that the Ba’ does not indicate something partial, rather it refers to making something stick, i.e., it is obligatory to make some of the water with which one is wiping the head stick to the head.\xa0(End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 21/123)\n\nThe report narrated by Muslim (247) from Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wiped his forelock and his turban. They said: He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only wiped the forelock, which is at the front of the head.\n\nThe response to that is that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wiped his forelock and completed the wiping over his turban, and wiping the turban took the place of wiping over the head.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad Al-Ma`ad (1/193): There is no sound report in a single Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ever wiped over only part of his head. But if he wiped over his forelock, he completed the wiping by wiping over his turban. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Wiping over the forelock was sufficient here because he also wiped over the turban at the same time. So this does not indicate that it is permissible to wipe over the forelock only. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/178)\nThus it seems that the more correct of the two views is the view that it is obligatory to wipe over the entire head when doing Wudu.\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (5/227):\nIt is obligatory to wipe over the entire head when doing Wudu, because Allah Says “rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads”, and because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from `Abdullah ibn Zayd ibn `Asim (may Allah be pleased with him) describing Wudu, in which he said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wiped his head, moving his hands forwards and backwards.” According to another version: “He started at the front of his head until he moved them (his hands) to the back, then he brought them back to the place where he had started.” (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (1/187): If he wipes the forelock only and not the rest of the head, that is not sufficient, because Allah says: “rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:6] And He did not say, “part of your heads.” (End quote)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/70530/is-wiping-part-of-the-head-enough-in-wudu

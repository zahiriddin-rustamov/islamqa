235537,"What do you think of someone who says that it is not obligatory to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in everything, because he was human and he may try to work something out, then get it wrong or get it right?","['Praise be to Allah.Obeying the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is obligatory; in fact it is one of the fundamentals of faith, as the Quran indicates. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe, obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those of you who are in authority. If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you [truly] believe in Allah and the Last Day; that is better and more seemly in the end}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:59]\n{Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and be on your guard. But if you turn away, then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the message in the clearest way}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:92]\n{We did not send any Messenger except to be obeyed by Allah’s leave}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:64].\nAllah, may He be exalted, tells us that no one truly believes until he makes the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) judge concerning what he faces in his life of novel events, and he finds no reservation in his heart towards his ruling, and he accepts it wholeheartedly. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:65].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir, 2/349:\nRegarding the words {But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them}: here Allah, may He be exalted, swears by His divine essence that no one truly believes until he refers judgement to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him in all his affairs, for whatever he rules is the truth which the believer must accept wholeheartedly, both inwardly and outwardly. Hence Allah says: {then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}. That is, when they refer to you for judgement, then they must obey you inwardly and not feel any reservations about your verdict, and they must submit to it both outwardly and inwardly. So they should submit to it completely, without any reluctance, objection or dispute, as it is narrated in the hadith: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of you truly believes until his inclinations are in accordance with what I have brought.” (End quote)\nIn his beneficial and blessed book Riyadh as-Salihin, Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter entitled: the Chapter on the command to adhere to the Sunnah and the etiquette learned therefrom.\nIn this chapter, he quoted a number of verses from the Quran which are indicative of this important principle of faith, as clear evidence in which there is no confusion or doubt:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says:\n{Whatever the Messenger gives you [of the gains, or of instructions], accept it, and whatever he forbids to you, refrain from it}\xa0[al-Hashr 59:7]\n{nor does he speak of his own accord;\nIt is but divine inspiration}\xa0[an-Najm 53:3-4]\n{Say: If you love Allah then follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins}\xa0[Al `Imran 3:31]\n{Verily, in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example for those who look with hope to Allah and the Last Day}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:21]\n{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:65]]\n{If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:59].\nThe scholars said: What is meant is referring to the Quran and Sunnah.\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:80]\n{And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path,\nThe path of Allah}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:52-53]\n{So let those who go against his command beware lest some calamity strikes them or a painful punishment befalls them}\xa0[an-Nur 24:63]\n{And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:34]\nand there are many similar verses. (End quote).\nIn the same chapter, he also quoted a number of hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which affirm this principle. These hadiths include the following:\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” It was said: Who would refuse, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari) It is very strange for someone to claim that following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not obligatory, when Allah, may He be exalted, has connected guidance and success to following and obeying him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him that you may be guided}\xa0[al-A`raf 7:158]\n{If you obey him, you will be rightly guided. The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message in the clearest way}\xa0[an-Nur 24:54].\nOne of the things that the Muslim must believe is that the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which is his path – meaning his words and actions regarding religious matters – is infallible.\nIf the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made a decision on the basis of his personal opinion, and it turned out to be incorrect, revelation would come down straightaway to correct it and show what Allah wanted and what His ruling was concerning a specific, new development. This is what is proven in the Quran, in passages such as the following:\n{It is not befitting for a Prophet to take captives until he has thoroughly suppressed [the enemy] in the land. You desire the fleeting gains of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise.\nWere it not for a prior decree from Allah, a grievous punishment would have befallen you for what you took [of ransom].\nSo enjoy what you have gained in war as lawful and good, but fear Allah; verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}\n[al-Anfal 8:67-69]\n{It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire\nAnd the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to Abraham that his father was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:113-114]\n{O Prophet, why do you prohibit [for yourself] that which Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nAllah has already prescribed for you a way of releasing yourselves from your oaths. Allah is your Guardian, and He is All-Knowing, Most Wise}\xa0[at-Tahrim 66:1-2].\nConclusion: the one who raised this objection has not understood anything about following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the importance thereof in the religion of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He has not understood the evidence that points to that, and when he objected to this fundamental principle, he has not objected with something that will benefit him or that has anything to do with the issue under discussion.\nWould that this doubter, if he is confused about something, would refer the matter to people of authority, such as the scholars and jurists, so that they could respond to the doubt that he has in his mind.\nMay Allah show us the path of guidance and enable us to follow it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/235537/he-claims-that-it-is-not-obligatory-to-follow-the-prophet-in-everything
182542,What is the ruling for hair transplants for the beard if it is sparse?,"['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on Beard Hair Transplants in Islam\nIt is not permissible to do hair transplants for the beard unless that is for the purpose of treating a problem and removing a defect, such as if it was lost or there was some deformity because of sickness or burns, for example. That is because transplanting hair for the beard for purposes other than these comes under the heading of changing the creation of Allah.\nEvidence from the Sunnah on Cosmetic Corrections\nEvidence for the permissibility of using cosmetic means to remove or correct an acquired defect is to be found in the report narrated by Abu Dawud (4232), At-Tirmidhi (1770) and An-Nasa’i (5161) from `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Tarafah who said that his grandfather `Arfajah ibn As`ad’s nose was cut off on the day of (the Battle of) Al-Kulab, and he wore a nose made of silver, but it began to stink, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to get a nose made of gold.\nThe Hadith was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\nPermissible Scenarios for Beard Hair Transplants\nDr. Salih ibn Muhammad Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: It seems to me that there are two scenarios with regard to the beard:\n\nThe first scenario is where the growth is naturally sparse, in which case it is not permissible to increase it by means of hair transplants for the following reasons:\n\n\nWhat is meant by the command to let the beard grow is to leave the beard alone and not remove anything from it by cutting or shaving. There is nothing in that command to indicate that it is prescribed to increase it by means of hair transplants, and by analogy it is not prescribed to increase it by means of remedies. In fact it is more likely that transplants are not allowed because of the side-effects and complications to which that may lead.\nDoing hair transplants for the beard when there is no need to do so comes under the heading of changing the creation of Allah, may He be Exalted. Simply wanting to look more handsome or to look a certain way is not sufficient to make this change permissible. Moreover, it involves surgery and exposing oneself to side-effects and complications of this surgical procedure.\n\n\nThe second scenario is where the hair of the beard does not increase or it falls out because of sickness or an accident. In this case it seems to me – and Allah knows best – that it is permissible to do a hair transplant for the beard, because this comes under the heading of medical treatment and removing defects, especially if that sickness or accident has left the man looking deformed.

132820,"In our country, we often say “Allah ghalib (Allah’s decree always prevails)”, and that may be in the context of an excuse for not doing something. So for example, you might say to a person: Why did you not do such and such? And he will answer by saying: Allah ghalib. Or you may say: Why did you not keep your promise? And he will answer by saying: Allah ghalib. What is the ruling on saying this, especially in that context?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah’s decree always prevails, though most people do not realize}\xa0[Yusuf 12:21].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThat is, if Allah wants something to happen, it cannot be stopped, prevented or opposed; rather He is the One Whose decree always prevails over everything else.\nSa`id ibn Jubayr said: That is, He does whatever He wills. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/378).\nShaykh as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThat is, His decree is always executed and nothing can cancel it out or oppose it, {though most people do not realize}. That is why they try to take measures to overcome the universal decree of Allah, but they are too weak and helpless to achieve that. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa`di, p. 395)\nThis is like the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says: He is Dominant over His slaves} [al-An`am 6:18], and similar verses.\nSo if someone says “Allah ghalib (Allah’s decree always prevails)” intending to ascribe to Allah overwhelming power, might, glory and subjugation, then he has described Allah as He deserves.\nBut if his intention when saying that is to justify himself when falling short or committing sin, then he is misusing the concept of the divine decree as justification for that, because the divine decree can only be referred to when calamity befalls a person, and cannot be used to justify faults and shortcomings.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is obligatory to believe in the divine decree, but it is not permissible to use it as justification for going against the commands, prohibitions, promise and warning of Allah. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 1/155)\nHe also said:\nAs using the divine decree as justification in such a manner is wrong according to people’s common sense and reason, no nation ever used it as justification (for sins and shortcomings). No interest could ever be achieved on the basis of this argument, in this world or the hereafter. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 1/167)\nShaykh as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNo wise person accepts the use of the divine decree as justification (for sins and shortcomings), even if he sometimes refers to it as justification for his situation, he would not persist in doing that. From an Islamic point of view, Allah has stated that using the divine decree as justification is wrong, and He did not mention that in the Quran except as something that was said by the polytheists who disbelieved in His messengers. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa`di, 1/763)\nMuslim (2664) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say ‘If only I had done (such and such), then such and such would have happened,’ rather say: ‘It is the decree of Allah and what He wills, He does,’ for ‘if only’ opens the door to the work of the Shaytan.”\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHere the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructs the believer, when calamity befalls him, to connect his calamity to the divine decree and not dwell on the past; rather he should realize that what has befallen him could not have missed him, and what has missed him could not have befallen him. So he should think of the divine decree at the time of calamity and seek forgiveness from his shortcomings. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 8/77)\nHe also said:\nMan is not enjoined to think of the divine decree when he is enjoined to do what Allah has commanded him to do; rather he is enjoined to think of the divine decree when calamities befall him that he has no way to avoid. So whatever troubles befall you as a result of the actions of human beings or otherwise, you should show patience, accept it and surrender your affairs to Allah. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 8/178)\nIt may be said to this person: As Allah’s decree always prevails, Allah, may He be exalted, is also a fair judge, and His is the creation and the command. He has commanded us to obey Him and has forbidden us to disobey Him, so referring to His decree and citing it as an excuse for going against His religion is the way of the polytheists, as Allah, may He be exalted, has told us, as He says:\n{When they do something shameful, they say: We found our fathers doing this and Allah has enjoined it upon us. Say: Verily, Allah does not enjoin that which is shameful. Would you attribute to Allah something of which you have no knowledge?\nSay [O Muhammad]: My Lord has enjoined the doing of what is right; direct your worship only to Him whenever you pray, and call upon Him with sincere devotion to Him alone.

103432,"What is your opinion about a person who falsely divorces his wife, i.e. formally having the divorce contract, without saying the word of talaq actually to her? This enables him to marry a European woman in order to get a residency. Then he will divorce the European woman and return his first wife to him afterwards. What is the ruling on this matter?","['Praise be to Allah.The Sacred Nature of Marriage in Islam\nMarriage is a serious covenant and it is one of the most important rulings of Shari`ah, by means of which intimacy becomes permissible and rights such as the Mahr (dowry) and inheritance are proven, and children are attributed to their father, and other rulings.\nToying with Marriage and Divorce Contracts is Forbidden\nBy means of divorce, a woman becomes forbidden for her husband and is deprived of inheritance, and she becomes permissible for other men to marry, subject to well-known conditions.\nOur aim in explaining all this is to alert the Muslims to the necessity of not using these two contracts in ways other than that which has been prescribed by Allah, and not using them as tricks.\nWe have seen – unfortunately – men who will marry a woman not so that the intimacy with her which was forbidden becomes permissible, and not so as to form a family with her – as is the aim of the Shar`i contract – but so as to attain some worldly purpose, such as registering land, or getting a licence to open a business, or to get residency, or to enable the woman to travel outside her country.\nIn none of these cases is the man a husband or the woman a wife in the real sense, rather he is a husband on paper only! It is not more than ink on paper. This is a kind of toying with the rulings of Shari`ah. It is not permissible to do it or to take part in it, and it is essential to try to stop it when the aim is to achieve some prohibited purpose, such as the one who does that in order to get residency in a non-Muslim country.\nThe same may be said with regard to divorce. It is a Shar`i ruling and it is not permissible for anyone to take it lightly or to toy with its rulings. They call that a divorce on paper.\nThese people should all realise that they are sinning by doing this. Allah has not prescribed marriage and divorce so that the wife might be a name on the contract with no rulings and rights. They should realise that the rulings come into effect merely by virtue of the contract being done, if the conditions and essential parts of it are fulfilled, and that if any of these are missing it is invalid, and that divorce from the husband takes place if the words are merely uttered. There is no such thing in Shari`ah as marriage on paper and divorce on paper. The sin is further compounded if it is done in order to do something that is prohibited in the first place, such as one who uses it to avoid giving people their rights or paying debts to them, or if a woman uses it to get help given to divorcees by a state or institution, or so that she can live in a non-Muslim state where it is not permissible for her to reside, and other invalid, forbidden aims.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe Lawgiver forbids treating the Verses (Laws) of Allah as a jest [Al-Baqarah 2:231] and forbids a man to speak of the Verses of Allah which are binding contracts except in a serious manner as they are meant to be. Hence it is forbidden to take them lightly and or to marry a divorced woman in order to divorce her so that it will be permissible for her to go back to her first husband. This is indicated by the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): {And treat not the Verses (Laws) of Allah as a jest} [Al-Baqarah 2:231], and by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “What is the matter with people who toy with the sacred limits of Allah and make a mockery of His verses (laws), (and say), I divorce you, I take you back, I divorce you, I take you back?” It should be understood that toying with them is prohibited. (End quote from Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 6/65)\nBased on this, if a man marries a woman who is permissible for him, and it is done in accordance with the conditions prescribed in Shari`ah, with the essential parts being fulfilled and in the absence of any impediments, then it is a valid marriage with all that that implies.\nIf a man divorces his wife verbally, it counts as a divorce, even if he does not intend it as such.\nAs for a written divorce that is not uttered out loud, that is subject to further discussion as explained in the answer to question no.\xa072291.\nMarriage Solely for Residency: A Forbidden Act\nMarrying that European woman for the purpose of obtaining residency and then divorcing her is a forbidden action. We have quoted the Fatwa of Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) prohibiting such actions in the answer to question no.\xa02886.\nThis applies if he marries her without fulfilling the conditions of marriage, such as if he marries her without a guardian, or if there is any impediment to the validity of the marriage, such as if she is an adulteress who has not repented, or she is not one of the people of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian), in which case marriage to her is prohibited and is invalid.\nIf he marries her in a marriage that fulfils all the necessary parts and\xa0conditions, and is free of any impediments, then his marriage is valid with all that that implies, but his intention is forbidden.\nDeception and Trickery in Marriage Are Major Sins\nThese reprehensible actions of obtaining a divorce paper for the first wife and marrying another woman for the purpose of obtaining residency, then divorcing her, include two other things that are prohibited:\n\nTrickery, lying and giving false witness, because it is deceiving the state and tricking it in order to obtain nationality, which is prohibited.\nHe wants to do the divorce and marriage on paper in order to get residency in a non-Muslim country, but in our religion it is forbidden to settle among the disbelievers unnecessarily, because of the great danger that this poses to one’s religious commitment and morals, and to the individual and the family.\n\nIt was narrated from Jarir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I disavow any Muslim who settles among the polytheists.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2645; and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nWhat we advise our brothers to do is to fear Allah, may He be Exalted, with regard to Shar`i contracts and not to use them as means to worldly ends, and to refrain altogether if the purposes are prohibited. They should fear Allah with regard to their wives and children, and think about the great hardship that their actions may lead to, or the deprivation of rights and other negative consequences that may result from doing these contracts in this corrupt manner.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 22728, 116994, 113867, 364.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103432/is-sham-marriage-allowed-in-islam%C2%A0

258305,I would like to enquire about RSU (Restricted Stock Unit). I am working in a company whereby employees are granted RSUs when they are hired.,"['Praise be to Allah.First: There is no harm for the employee to accept these restricted shares. When the time comes for their entitlement, if they are pure shares: he may choose the first option, which is to keep the remaining shares. If they are mixed shares, he must sell all of them.\nA pure share: is one that belongs to a company whose activity is permissible and does not engage in prohibited transactions, such as borrowing or depositing with interest (Riba).\nA mixed share: is one that belongs to a company whose activity is permissible, but it borrows with interest or deposits its money and receives interest on it.\nA prohibited share: is one that belongs to a company or entity whose activity is prohibited, such as shares of usurious banks, casinos, brothels, and the like.\nThe International Islamic Fiqh Council, belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, in its seventh conference session in Jeddah, stated:\n“The basic principle is that\xa0it is prohibited to own shares in companies that sometimes deal with prohibited things, such as Riba and the like, despite their main activities being legitimate.” (End quote from the Council’s magazine, seventh issue, part 1, page 73)\nIn the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League in Makkah Al-Mukarramah in its fourteenth session:\n“1- Since the basic principle in transactions is permissibility, establishing a joint-stock company with permissible purposes and activities is legally permissible.\n2- There is no disagreement on the prohibition of owning shares in companies whose main purpose is prohibited, such as dealing with Riba or manufacturing and trading in prohibited items.\n3- It is not permissible for a Muslim to buy shares of companies and banks if some of their transactions involve Riba, and the buyer knows this.\n4- If a person buys without knowing that the company deals with Riba, then learns about it: he must sell the shares.\nThe prohibition in this is clear due to the general evidence from the Quran and Sunnah in prohibiting Riba; and because buying shares of companies that deal with Riba, with the buyer’s knowledge of this: means the buyer’s participation in dealing with Riba, because the share represents a common part of the company’s capital, and the shareholder owns a common share in the company’s assets. So for any money the company lends with interest, or borrows with interest: the shareholder has a share in it, because those who directly lend and borrow with interest: do this work on his behalf, and with his authorization, and authorizing a prohibited act: is not permissible.\nMay Allah’s peace and blessings be upon our master Muhammad, his family, and his Companions, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (End quote from the League’s website: http://www.themwl.org/Fatwa/default.aspx?d=1&cidi=138&l=AR&cid=10)\nSecond: If the share is mixed, and does not enter the employee’s ownership until the time of entitlement, he should sell it immediately, and he is not obligated to purify it, meaning getting rid of the prohibited amount; because the share did not result in any interest.\nIf it entered his ownership since he was employed, but he was prevented from disposing of it, he must get rid of the prohibited percentage when selling it. This percentage is known by referring to the company and determining the percentage of the usurious loan or usurious interest from its shares.\nPlease see the answer to question number (198281) for more information.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258305/rsu-restricted-stock-unit
71183,"I am working to help my husband for our living, as his salary is not sufficient for our basic needs and education of our kids. I have borrowed some money from different people to settle our other debts. Alhamdulillah, I can say that ALLAH tests our faith in terms of “money”. One day, I was listening to a lecture about severe punishment for a Muslim who has not settled his debts and he also mentioned that during the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessing be upon him), he never prayed to the deceased person who has not settled his debts. The lecturer mentioned a dua but I was not able to write it down. Can you please tell me what are punishments in the grave and dua to help me settle my debts?","['Praise be to Allah.Definition of debt according to Islamic jurisprudence\nThe jurists define Dayn (debt) as an obligation to be fulfilled, as it says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (21/102).\nThe linguistic meaning of the word debt in Arabic has to do with submission and humiliation. The connection between the Shar`i meaning and the linguistic meaning is clear. The debtor is a prisoner, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your companion is being detained by his debt.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3341; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nThe Gravity of debt in Islamic teachings\n\xa0Islam takes the matter of debt very seriously and warns against it and urges the Muslim to avoid it as much as possible.\nIt was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say in his prayer: “Allahumma inni a`udhi bika min Al-ma`tham wal-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from sin and debt).” Someone said to him: “How often do you seek refuge from debt!” He said: “When a man gets into debt, he speaks and tells lies, and he makes a promise and breaks it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 832 and Muslim, 589)\nAn-Nasa`i (4605) narrated that Muhammad ibn Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n“We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he raised his head towards the sky, then he put his palm on his forehead and said: “Subhan-Allah!\xa0 What a strict issue has been revealed to me!” We remained silent and were afraid. The following morning I asked him, “O Messenger of Allah, what is this strict issue that has been revealed?” He said, “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if a man were killed in battle for the sake of Allah, then brought back to life, then killed and brought back to life again, then killed, and he owed a debt, he would not enter Paradise until his debt was paid off.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa`i, 4367)\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refrained from offering the funeral prayer for one who had died owing two dinars, until Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) promised to pay it off for him. When he saw him the following day and said, I have paid it off, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Now his skin has become cool for him.”(Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad, 3/629; classed as sound by An-Nawawi in Al-Khulasah, 2/931 and by Ibn Muflih in Al-Adab Al-Shar`iyyah, 1/104)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fat-h Al-Bari (4/547):\n“This Hadith indicates how difficult the issue of debt is, and that it should not be undertaken except in cases of necessity.” (End quote)\nIt was narrated from Thawban (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“Whoever dies free from three things – arrogance, cheating and debt – will enter Paradise.”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1572; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\xa0“The soul of the believer is suspended because of his debt until it is paid off.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1078)\nAl-Mubarakfuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi (4/164):\n“The words “the soul of the believer is suspended” – As-Suyuti said: i.e., it is detained and kept from reaching its noble destination. Al-`Iraqi said: i.e., no judgement is passed as to whether it will be saved or doomed until it is determined whether his debt will be paid off or not.”\nThe Salaf emphasise the avoidance of debt\nIt was also narrated that many of the Salaf warned against debt:\nIt was narrated that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n“Beware of debt, for it starts with worry and it ends with war.” (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta`, 2/770)\nIn Musannaf `Abd Al-Razzaq (3/57) it says:\nIbn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n“O Humran, fear Allah and do not die in debt, lest it be taken from your good deeds when there will be no dinars and no dirhams.”\nPersonal and societal impacts of debt\nThese stern warnings about debt only came because of the negative consequences to which it leads both on an individual level and on a community level.\n\nWith regard to the personal level, Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jami` li Ahkam Al-Quran (3/417):\n\n“Our scholars said: It is a disgrace and a humiliation because it preoccupies the mind and makes one worried about paying it off, and makes one feel humiliated before the lender when meeting him, and feeling that he is doing one a favour when accepting a delay in payment. Perhaps he may promise himself that he will pay it off then break that promise, or speak to the lender and lie to him, or swear an oath to him then break it, and so on. Moreover, he may die without having paid off the debt so he will be held hostage because of it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The soul of the believer is held hostage by his debt in his grave until it is paid off.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1078” All of that undermines one’s religious commitment.\n\nWith regard to the community level, specialists have described the negative consequences and the danger it poses to the economy, for example:\n\n\nDesire for immediate gratification with no thought of the future\nLack of responsibility and self-reliance\nPoor distribution of wealth\n\nIn order to understand these negative consequences better, please see the study by Shaykh Sami As-Suwaylim entitled Mawqif Al-Shari`ah Al-Islamiyyah min Al-Dayn (6-11)\nPermissible conditions for taking on debt in Islam\nBased on the above, the scholars have stipulated three conditions for debt to be permissible:\n\nThe borrower should be determined to repay it.\nIt should be known or thought most likely that he is able to repay it,\nIt should be for something that is permissible according to Shari`ah.\n\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Tamhid (23/238):\n“The debt for which a person will be kept out of Paradise – and Allah knows best – is that for which he left behind enough to pay it off but he did not leave instructions to that effect, or he was able to pay it off but did not do so, or he took the loan for some unlawful or extravagant matter and died without having paid it off.\nAs for the one who took a loan for something lawful because he was poor, and he died without leaving behind anything to pay it off, Allah will not keep him from Paradise because of it, in sha Allah.” (End quote)\nGuidance for those in debt\nSo long as you have taken on a debt so that you can fulfil the duty of helping your husband and family to pay for living expenses, you will be rewarded by Allah for this good deed. I ask Allah to reward you greatly for that. Remember that He will help you to pay off this debt.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who takes people`s wealth intending to pay it back, Allah will pay it back for him, and the one who takes it intending to destroy it, Allah will destroy him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2387)\nSeek help with that by working and striving hard to pay off the debt, and by putting your trust in Allah, and praying to Him to make it easy for you to pay off your debt.\nRecommended Du`as for seeking Allah’s help in paying off debts\nIn the Sunnah there are a number of Du`as which specifically seek the help of Allah in praying off debts. They are:\n\nIt was narrated that Suhayl (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Abu Salih used to tell us, when one of us wanted to sleep, to lie down on his right side and say:\n\n“Allahumma Rabb As-samawati wal-ard wa Rabb Al-`arsh il-`adhim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay`in, Faliq Al-habb wan-nawa wa munzil At-Tawrati wal-Injili wal-Furqan, a`udhu bika min sharri kulli shay`in anta akhidhun bi nasiyatihi. Allahumma anta Al-awwal fa laysa qablaka shay`un, wa anta Al-akhir fa laysa ba`daka shay`un, wa anta Adh-Dhahir fa laysa fawqaka shay`un wa anta Al-batin fa laysa dunaka shay`un. Iqdi `anna Ad-dayna wa aghnina min Al-faqri (O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and the exalted Throne, our Lord and Lord of all things, splitter of the seed and the date-stone, Revealer of the Tawrat and the Injeel and the Furqan [Quran], I seek refuge in You from the evil of all things You shall seize by the forelock [have total mastery over]. O Allah, You are the First so there is nothing before You, and You are the Last so there is nothing after You. You are Adh-Dhahir [the greatest and highest] so there is nothing above You, and You are Al-Batin [aware of the subtlest secrets] so there is nothing closer than You. Settle our debt for us and spare us from poverty).”\nHe narrated that from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Narrated by Muslim, 2713)\n\nIt was narrated from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that a Mukatib (slave who had entered into a contract of manumission) came to him and said: “I am unable to pay off my manumission; help me.” He said: “Shall I not tell you some words which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me? And if you have debt like the mountain of Seer, Allah will pay it off for you. He said: `Say: Allahumma akfini bi halalika `an haramika wa aghnini bi fadlika `amman siwaka (O Allah, suffice me with what You have permitted so that that I have no need of that which You have forbidden, and make me independent of means by Your bounty so that I have no need of anyone besides You).’” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2563. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.)\n\n\xa0It was narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the mosque and saw an Ansari man whose name was Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him). He said: “O Abu Umamah, why do I see you sitting in the mosque when it is not the time for prayer? He said: Worries and debts, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Shall I not teach you some words which, if you say them, Allah will take away your worries and pay off your debts?” He said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said:\n“Say, morning and evening, `“Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min Al-hammi wal-hazani, wa a`udhi bika min Al-`ajzi wal-kasali, wa a`udhu bika min Al-jubni wal-bukhli, wa a`udhi bika min ghalabat il-dayn wa qahri Ar-rijal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from worry and grief, and I seek refuge with You from incapacity and laziness, and I seek refuge with You from cowardice and miserliness, and I seek refuge with You from being in debt and from being overcome by men).”\nHe said; I did that, and Allah took away my worry and paid off my debt. (Narrated by Abu Dawud (1555) Its chain of narration includes Ghassan ibn `Awf; Adh-Dhahabi said: he is not strong. Hence Shaykh Al-Albani classed the Hadith as inauthentic in Da`if Abu Dawud. But the Du`a mentioned – “Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min Al-hammi wal-hazani…” – is confirmed by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in a report other than this story of Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/71183/seriousness-of-debt-in-islam
262489,A – Loan Taker.,"['Praise be to Allah.First: The lender paying Zakah on the debt owed to him has some details:\n\nIf the debt is owed by a wealthy person who is able to pay and acknowledges the debt, the lender must pay Zakah on it.\nIf the debt is owed by an insolvent person or someone who denies the debt, the lender is not obligated to pay Zakah on it until he receives it. Then he pays Zakah on it once.\n\nPlease see the answer to question number (125854).\nSecond: It is permissible for the lender to say to the debtor: Give what you owe to such and such poor person, intending it as Zakah, if the debt is present with the debtor and he has offered it to its owner. This falls under delegating the payment of Zakah, as if the lender received his debt and then gave it to the poor person.\nAs-Sarakhsi (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said: “If he gives it in charity to another poor person and orders him to receive it from him, intending it as his Zakah, it is sufficient for him. This is because that poor person is his agent in receiving it, as if he received it himself and then gave it in charity to him, intending it as his Zakah. Similarly, if he receives it and then gives it in charity to the debtor, intending it as his Zakah, it is sufficient if he is poor, just as if he gave it in charity to someone else. If he is rich and he knows that, it does not count as Zakah and he is liable for the Zakah on this thousand.” (Al-Mabsut, 3/36)\nBut does the debtor have the choice – as mentioned in the question – between giving it to the poor person or keeping it for himself? The answer: No, and there are three scenarios for this:\nFirst: If the lender specifies a poor person to whom the Zakah should be given, the debtor cannot give it to anyone else.\nSecond: If he does not specify a poor person and allows the debtor to take the Zakah for himself, this is waiving the debt and counting it as Zakah, which is not allowed.\nIt is stated in “Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah” (23/300): “It is not permissible for the creditor to waive his debt from his poor, insolvent debtor who has nothing to pay his debt with, and count it as part of his Zakah. If he does so, it does not count as Zakah. This is the opinion of the Hanafi, Hanbali, and Maliki schools except for Ashhab, and it is the most correct view according to the Shafi`i school, and the opinion of Abu `Ubayd.”\nThe reason for prohibition is that Zakat is a right of Allah Almighty. Therefore, it is not permissible for a person to spend it on benefiting himself, reviving his wealth, or fulfilling his debt. The Shafi’is in one opinion, Ashhab from the Malikis, and it is narrated from Al-Hasan Al-Basri and `Ata’: It is permissible because if he gave him his Zakat and then took it back for his debt, it would be permissible, so this is the same.\nIf the creditor pays the Zakat of his wealth to his debtor, and the debtor returns it to him to settle his debt, or if the debtor borrows what he needs to pay off his debt, gives it to the creditor, and the creditor returns it to him and counts it as Zakat, then if this is not a trick, collusion, or intended to revive his wealth: it is permissible according to the majority, and it is an opinion of the Malikis.\nThe third scenario: The lender does not specify a poor person, nor does he give permission to the debtor. Rather, the debtor takes it for himself without his knowledge. If he is not eligible for Zakat, this is a betrayal that is not permissible. If he is eligible, the majority opinion is that it is prohibited for the agent distributing Zakat to take it for himself. Please see: Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq (1/305), Kashshaf Al-Qina` (3/363). Please see the answer to question number (49899).\nIt is clear here that the lender intended to deliver the Zakah to a poor person other than the debtor. If he had intended it for the debtor, it would not have been permissible, as mentioned in the second scenario. This clarifies that it is not permissible for the debtor to keep the money for himself, even if he is eligible for Zakah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262489/if-the-lender-tells-the-debtor-to-give-what-he-owes-to-a-poor-person-as-zakah-is-it-permissible-for-him-to-keep-the-money-for-himself
47682,Is it permissible to Call the Adhan in a Singing Tone?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is disliked to sing the Adhan in the sense of elongating the words excessively without changing the meaning. If the meaning is changed, then it becomes prohibited and the Adhan is not correct in this\xa0case.\nIbn Abi Shaybah (259) narrated that a Mu’adhdhin gave the Adhan and elongated the words in his Adhan and made it sound like singing. `Umar ibn `Abd Al-`Aziz (may Allah have mercy on him) said to him: Give a gentle Adhan otherwise keep away from us.\nWhat is meant by a gentle Adhan is one without singing it.\xa0(End quote from Al-Maghrib fi Lughat Al-Fiqh by Abu Al-Makarim Al-Matrazi Al-Hanafi, p 234)\nIt says in Al-Mudawwanah (1/159):\nMalik regarded it as disliked to sing the Adhan and disliked that intensely.\nImam Ash-Shafi`i said in Al-Umm (1/107):\nI like the Adhan to be recited clearly without elongating any words or rushing it.\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah:\nThe jurists agreed that elongating the words of the Adhan and singing it and adding any elongation or letter at the beginning or the end is disliked, because it is contrary to proper focus and dignity. But if the singing and elongation\xa0changes the meaning then it is prohibited and there is no scholarly dispute on this point, because it was narrated that a man said to Ibn `Umar: “I love you for the sake of Allah.” He said: “I hate you for the sake of Allah, for you sing the Adhan.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the Adhan that is sung, this means giving the Adhan with a tune as if singing a song. It is valid but it is disliked.\nAnd he said: But making grammatical mistakes in the Adhan falls into two categories, one which renders the Adhan invalid, which is when the meaning is changed, and one in which the Adhan is valid but is disliked, which is when the meaning is not changed. For example, if the Mu’adhdhin says “Allahu akbar” (elongating the `a’ sound), this is not valid because it changes the meaning, because Akbar is the plural of Kabar, which is a type of drum.\xa0(End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/62)\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Excessive elongation is not appropriate, and if the vowels are elongated to such an extent that the meaning is changed, this is not valid, otherwise it is disliked. (End quote from Fatawa Ash-Shaykh, 1/125)\nThe point is that singing the Adhan is disliked, and may render the Adhan invalid if it changes the meaning.\nFor more details, please see the following answers:\nModulation and elongation of vowels in the Adhan\nMeaning of taghanni in Quran recitation\nIs exaggerating in beautifying the voice when leading people in prayer regarded as showing off?\nRuling on using auto-tune and vocal effects for the Quran\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47682/is-it-permissible-to-call-the-adhan-in-a-singing-tone

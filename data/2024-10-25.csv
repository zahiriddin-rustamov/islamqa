132520,"What is your opinion on the operations that are carried out in Muslim countries and are aimed at killing foreigners, but they lead to the killing of numerous Muslims too, along with the destruction of buildings and infrastructure? Does this come under the heading of jihad, as those who carry out such operations claim?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThese operations that are carried out in Muslim countries and are aimed at killing foreigners, as you say, are not jihad. Rather they come under the heading of spreading mischief, destruction and distorting the concept of jihad, and they are indicative of the ignorance and foolishness of those who carry them out. Those foreigners are granted safety in Muslim lands, and they only entered those lands with permission, so it is not permissible to transgress against them by beating and robbing them, let alone killing them. Their lives and wealth are protected, and the one who transgresses against them is in grave danger, as al-Bukhari, 3166, narrated from `Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills a mu`ahid [a non-Muslim who has a covenant with the Muslims] will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, even though its fragrance may be smelled from a distance of forty years.”\nThis includes the dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], the mu`ahid [a non-Muslim who has a covenant with the Muslims] and the musta’man [non-Muslim who has been granted safety by the Muslims].\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fat-h al-Bari: What is meant is one who has a covenant with the Muslims, whether it is on the basis of jizyah, a truce granted by a Muslim ruler, or one who has been granted safety by a Muslim. End quote.\nThe words “one who has been granted safety by a Muslim” refer to what is known to jurists, which is that it is not stipulated that safety should be granted by a ruler or sultan; rather it may be granted by any ordinary Muslim. The foreigners referred to enter the Muslim lands after being granted safety by the state, and also by a Muslim individual in many cases. Therefore it is not permissible to transgress against them, even if they come from a country that is at war with the Muslims.\nAl-Bukhari, 3171, and Muslim, 336, narrated that Umm Hani’ bint Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I went to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) during the year of the Conquest and I found him doing ghusl, and his daughter Fatimah was screening him with a cloth. I greeted him with salaam, and he said: “Who is this?” I said: Umm Hani’ bint Abi Talib. He said: “Welcome, Umm Hani’.” When he had finished his ghusl, he stood and prayed eight rak`ahs, wrapped in a single garment. Then I said: O Messenger of Allah, the son of my mother `Ali is saying that he will kill a man to whom I have granted safety, So-and-so the son of Hubayrah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “We grant safety to the one to whom you have granted safety, O Umm Hani’.”\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever among us – whether a man or a woman or a slave – grants safety to one of them, that granting of safety is valid.\nTo sum up: if safety has been granted to some individuals whose people are at war with the Muslims, it is prohibited to kill them, take their wealth or transgress against them. Safety granted willingly by any adult Muslim of sound mind – male or female, free or slave – is valid. This was stated by ath-Thawri, al-Awza`i, ash-Shafa`i, Is-haq, Ibn al-Qasim and most of the scholars.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 9/195.\nSecondly:\nIf one who has been granted safety or has a covenant with the Muslims breaks that covenant, it is not permissible for any Muslim individual to kill him, because of the bad consequences that will result from that. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) refrained from killing `Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, the leader of the hypocrites, for fear that it would be said that Muhammad kills his companions. By the same token, it is not permissible for any individual Muslim to kill someone who apostatizes openly, whose life is no longer protected under Islamic law, for the reason that we have mentioned. How much evil and calamities such actions have brought upon the Muslims, and how much it has led to restrictions on efforts to call people to Islam and on the callers, and how often those with ulterior motives have used such incidents to distort the image of the truth and its followers.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to causing the death of Muslims whose lives are protected under Islamic law, this is a serious crime and grave sin, for “the destruction of the entire world is less grievous in the sight of Allah than the killing of a Muslim man,” as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said. Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 1395; at-Tirmidhi, 3987 and Ibn Majah, 2619, from `Ubaydullah ibn ‘Amr. Classed as authentic by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\nAs for these people’s claim that this is done in retaliation for the enemy using Muslims as human shields, this is to be rejected, and it is indicative of their ignorance and evildoing. We say that it is not permissible to kill a disbeliever whose life is not protected under Islamic law when he is alone [and is not using Muslims as human shields] because of the evil consequences that we mentioned above, so how about if, in addition to that, Muslims whose lives are protected under Islamic law are also killed?\nThus it becomes clear that the actions of these people are based on darkness upon darkness, and stem from ignorance, haste and a failure to consult the scholars, to whom we are enjoined to refer. Trustworthy and knowledgeable scholars are agreed that such operations are not allowed, and are to be regarded as crimes, because they are prohibited in the first place, or because of what they lead to of mischief and evil.\nEveryone should fear Allah, may He be exalted, and be very careful to avoid violating the protection that has been granted by Muslims to non-Muslims, and to avoid shedding blood unlawfully and bringing troubles to Muslims.\nMay Allah help us all to do that which He loves and is pleased with.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/132520/ruling-on-killing-foreigners-in-muslim-lands
72303,How is the martyr to be shrouded?,"['Praise be to Allah.Understanding the Sunnah on Shrouding Martyrs\nThe Sunnah is for the martyr to be buried in the clothes in which he was killed.\xa0(Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 2/368; Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/294; Al-Majmu`, 5/229 and Al-Mughni, 3/47)\nHadith References on Martyr Shrouding\nA number of Hadiths have been narrated concerning that, such as the following:\n\nAhmad (33144) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said on the day of Uhud: “Bury them in their clothes.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Talkhis Ahkam Al-Jana’iz, p. 36)\nIt was narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A man was struck with an arrow in his chest, or in his throat, and he died. He was wrapped in his clothes as he was, and we were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3133; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. Al-Hafidh said in At-Talkhis, 2/118; its chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim)\nIt was narrated that Khabbab ibn Al-Aratt (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When Mus`ab ibn `Umayr was killed on the day of Uhud, he left nothing but one sheet. If we covered his head with it, his feet became exposed and if we covered his feet with it his head became exposed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us: “Cover his head with it and put Idhkhir (a kind of grass) over his feet.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4047 and Muslim, 940)\n\nScholarly Opinions: Recommended vs. Obligatory\nThe jurists differed concerning the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to bury martyrs in their clothes – is it recommended and better, or is it obligatory? There are two views:\n\nThe first view is that it is recommended. This is the view of the Shafi`is and some of the Hanbalis.\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (5/229): His heir has the choice: if he wishes he may bury him in what he is wearing, or if he wishes he may remove it and bury him in something else. But not doing that is preferable. (End quote)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (3/471): This is not definite, but it is preferable. The heir may remove his clothes and bury him in something else. (End quote)\nThey quoted as evidence that it is not obligatory the report narrated by Ahmad (1421) from Az-Zubayr which says that his mother Safiyyah (who was the sister of Hamzah) came with two garments on the day of Uhud and said: “These are two garments that I have brought for my brother Hamzah, for I have heard that he has been killed. Shroud him in them.”\nHe said: So we brought the two garments to shroud Hamzah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with him) in them, and beside him there was a man of the Ansar who had been killed, and the same thing had been done to him as had been done to Hamzah.\nWe felt embarrassed to shroud Hamzah in two garments when the Ansari had no shroud, so we said: “One garment for Hamzah and one for the Ansari.” We measured them and one was bigger than the other, so we drew lots between them and we shrouded each of them in the garment that fit him. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Ahkam Al-Jana’iz, p. 62)\n\nThe second view is that the command is to be understood as meaning that it is obligatory. This is the view of the Malikis and Hanbalis, and was the view favoured by Ibn Al-Qayyim and Ash-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on them).\n\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (6/94): The correct view is that it is obligatory to bury him in the garments in which he was killed. (End quote)\nImam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If his heir wants to add to what he is wearing and he has something that will do as a shroud, he should not do that, even if that is available to him. Nothing should be added. (End quote from Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/294)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nayl Al-Awtar (4/50):\nIt seems that the command to bury the martyr in the clothes in which he was killed is to be understood as meaning that it is obligatory. (End quote)\nSpecial Circumstances for Shrouding Martyrs\nWith regard to the Hadith about Hamzah, they replied:\nHe was shrouded in another shroud because they (the non-Muslims) had mutilated him by cutting open his stomach and taking out his liver, and they had taken his clothes. That is why he was shrouded in another garment. This was stated by Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in Zad Al-Ma`ad, 3/217.\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person has been stripped by the enemy, there is no concession allowing him not to be shrouded, rather that is obligatory. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) shrouded two martyrs on the day of Uhud in one garment. (End quote from Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/294)\nIslamic Rulings on Removing Weapons and Accessories\nQuestion:\nShould whatever he has on him of weapons, furs, shoes, belts, caps, etc. be removed?\nWith regard to weapons, the scholars unanimously agreed that they should be removed.\nIbn Al-Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mudawwanah: his shield, sword and all weapons should be removed from him. (End quote from Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/294)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (5/229): The scholars agreed that metal and leather should be removed from him. (End quote)\nIt seems that what is meant by “leather” is weapons and tools of war, because just one line above that, he mentioned that there is a difference of opinion with regard to removing furs and shoes. So what is meant by leather here is weapons, such as the scabbard in which the sword is worn, or the quiver in which arrows are kept, and the like.\nThey quoted the following as evidence for that:\n\nThe report narrated by Abu Dawud (3134) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that the metal and leather be removed from those who had been slain at Uhud, and that they should be buried with their blood and garments.” (This was classed as inauthentic by Al-Hafidh in At-Talkhees, 2/118; it was also classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Da`if Abu Dawud)\nBut there is no need to refer to this inauthentic Hadith, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (23144), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said on the day of Uhud: “Wrap them in their garments.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Talkhis Ahkam Al-Jana’iz, p. 36. Metal and leather (weapons) are not among one’s garments, so they are not included in this Hadith. (Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 2/368 and Al-Mughni, 3/471)\n\nWith regard to furs, shoes, caps and belts, the scholars differed as to whether they should be removed, and there are two views.\n\nThat they should not be removed. This is the view of the Malikis.\n\nAl-Hattab (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Mawahib Al-Jalil (2/294): Ibn Al-Qasim said: … nothing should be removed from one who is wearing anything, neither his clothes, nor furs, nor shoes, nor cap. Mutarrif said: nor his ring, unless it has a precious stone, nor his belt, unless it is valuable. (End quote)\nThey quoted as evidence the words of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the martyrs of Uhud: “Wrap them in their garments.”\xa0 This is general in meaning and includes all their garments.\n\nThat they may be removed. This is the view of the Hanafis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis.\n\nThey quoted as evidence the following:\n\nThe Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that the metal and leather be removed from those who had been slain at Uhud, and that they should be buried with their blood and garments. This is inauthentic, as stated above.\nThe report narrated from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Furs, shoes and caps may be removed from the martyr. (This was classed as inauthentic by Ash-Shawkani in Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/50)\n\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bada’i` As-Sana’i` (2/368-369): This is because what is left is left as a shroud, and the shroud is what is worn for covering the body, and these things are worn either for beautification and adornment, or for protection from cold, or for protection from weapons, and the deceased has no need for any of that, so none of these things can be a shroud. Thus it is clear that what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Shroud them in their garments” is the clothes in which they are shrouded and which are worn to cover the body.

258305,I would like to enquire about RSU (Restricted Stock Unit). I am working in a company whereby employees are granted RSUs when they are hired.,"['Praise be to Allah.First: There is no harm for the employee to accept these restricted shares. When the time comes for their entitlement, if they are pure shares: he may choose the first option, which is to keep the remaining shares. If they are mixed shares, he must sell all of them.\nA pure share: is one that belongs to a company whose activity is permissible and does not engage in prohibited transactions, such as borrowing or depositing with interest (Riba).\nA mixed share: is one that belongs to a company whose activity is permissible, but it borrows with interest or deposits its money and receives interest on it.\nA prohibited share: is one that belongs to a company or entity whose activity is prohibited, such as shares of usurious banks, casinos, brothels, and the like.\nThe International Islamic Fiqh Council, belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, in its seventh conference session in Jeddah, stated:\n“The basic principle is that\xa0it is prohibited to own shares in companies that sometimes deal with prohibited things, such as Riba and the like, despite their main activities being legitimate.” (End quote from the Council’s magazine, seventh issue, part 1, page 73)\nIn the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League in Makkah Al-Mukarramah in its fourteenth session:\n“1- Since the basic principle in transactions is permissibility, establishing a joint-stock company with permissible purposes and activities is legally permissible.\n2- There is no disagreement on the prohibition of owning shares in companies whose main purpose is prohibited, such as dealing with Riba or manufacturing and trading in prohibited items.\n3- It is not permissible for a Muslim to buy shares of companies and banks if some of their transactions involve Riba, and the buyer knows this.\n4- If a person buys without knowing that the company deals with Riba, then learns about it: he must sell the shares.\nThe prohibition in this is clear due to the general evidence from the Quran and Sunnah in prohibiting Riba; and because buying shares of companies that deal with Riba, with the buyer’s knowledge of this: means the buyer’s participation in dealing with Riba, because the share represents a common part of the company’s capital, and the shareholder owns a common share in the company’s assets. So for any money the company lends with interest, or borrows with interest: the shareholder has a share in it, because those who directly lend and borrow with interest: do this work on his behalf, and with his authorization, and authorizing a prohibited act: is not permissible.\nMay Allah’s peace and blessings be upon our master Muhammad, his family, and his Companions, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (End quote from the League’s website: http://www.themwl.org/Fatwa/default.aspx?d=1&cidi=138&l=AR&cid=10)\nSecond: If the share is mixed, and does not enter the employee’s ownership until the time of entitlement, he should sell it immediately, and he is not obligated to purify it, meaning getting rid of the prohibited amount; because the share did not result in any interest.\nIf it entered his ownership since he was employed, but he was prevented from disposing of it, he must get rid of the prohibited percentage when selling it. This percentage is known by referring to the company and determining the percentage of the usurious loan or usurious interest from its shares.\nPlease see the answer to question number (198281) for more information.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/258305/rsu-restricted-stock-unit
71183,"I am working to help my husband for our living, as his salary is not sufficient for our basic needs and education of our kids. I have borrowed some money from different people to settle our other debts. Alhamdulillah, I can say that ALLAH tests our faith in terms of “money”. One day, I was listening to a lecture about severe punishment for a Muslim who has not settled his debts and he also mentioned that during the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessing be upon him), he never prayed to the deceased person who has not settled his debts. The lecturer mentioned a dua but I was not able to write it down. Can you please tell me what are punishments in the grave and dua to help me settle my debts?","['Praise be to Allah.Definition of debt according to Islamic jurisprudence\nThe jurists define Dayn (debt) as an obligation to be fulfilled, as it says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (21/102).\nThe linguistic meaning of the word debt in Arabic has to do with submission and humiliation. The connection between the Shar`i meaning and the linguistic meaning is clear. The debtor is a prisoner, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your companion is being detained by his debt.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3341; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\nThe Gravity of debt in Islamic teachings\n\xa0Islam takes the matter of debt very seriously and warns against it and urges the Muslim to avoid it as much as possible.\nIt was narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say in his prayer: “Allahumma inni a`udhi bika min Al-ma`tham wal-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from sin and debt).” Someone said to him: “How often do you seek refuge from debt!” He said: “When a man gets into debt, he speaks and tells lies, and he makes a promise and breaks it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 832 and Muslim, 589)\nAn-Nasa`i (4605) narrated that Muhammad ibn Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n“We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he raised his head towards the sky, then he put his palm on his forehead and said: “Subhan-Allah!\xa0 What a strict issue has been revealed to me!” We remained silent and were afraid. The following morning I asked him, “O Messenger of Allah, what is this strict issue that has been revealed?” He said, “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if a man were killed in battle for the sake of Allah, then brought back to life, then killed and brought back to life again, then killed, and he owed a debt, he would not enter Paradise until his debt was paid off.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa`i, 4367)\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refrained from offering the funeral prayer for one who had died owing two dinars, until Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) promised to pay it off for him. When he saw him the following day and said, I have paid it off, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Now his skin has become cool for him.”(Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad, 3/629; classed as sound by An-Nawawi in Al-Khulasah, 2/931 and by Ibn Muflih in Al-Adab Al-Shar`iyyah, 1/104)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fat-h Al-Bari (4/547):\n“This Hadith indicates how difficult the issue of debt is, and that it should not be undertaken except in cases of necessity.” (End quote)\nIt was narrated from Thawban (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“Whoever dies free from three things – arrogance, cheating and debt – will enter Paradise.”\xa0(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1572; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\xa0“The soul of the believer is suspended because of his debt until it is paid off.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1078)\nAl-Mubarakfuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi (4/164):\n“The words “the soul of the believer is suspended” – As-Suyuti said: i.e., it is detained and kept from reaching its noble destination. Al-`Iraqi said: i.e., no judgement is passed as to whether it will be saved or doomed until it is determined whether his debt will be paid off or not.”\nThe Salaf emphasise the avoidance of debt\nIt was also narrated that many of the Salaf warned against debt:\nIt was narrated that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n“Beware of debt, for it starts with worry and it ends with war.” (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta`, 2/770)\nIn Musannaf `Abd Al-Razzaq (3/57) it says:\nIbn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\n“O Humran, fear Allah and do not die in debt, lest it be taken from your good deeds when there will be no dinars and no dirhams.”\nPersonal and societal impacts of debt\nThese stern warnings about debt only came because of the negative consequences to which it leads both on an individual level and on a community level.\n\nWith regard to the personal level, Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jami` li Ahkam Al-Quran (3/417):\n\n“Our scholars said: It is a disgrace and a humiliation because it preoccupies the mind and makes one worried about paying it off, and makes one feel humiliated before the lender when meeting him, and feeling that he is doing one a favour when accepting a delay in payment. Perhaps he may promise himself that he will pay it off then break that promise, or speak to the lender and lie to him, or swear an oath to him then break it, and so on. Moreover, he may die without having paid off the debt so he will be held hostage because of it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The soul of the believer is held hostage by his debt in his grave until it is paid off.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1078” All of that undermines one’s religious commitment.\n\nWith regard to the community level, specialists have described the negative consequences and the danger it poses to the economy, for example:\n\n\nDesire for immediate gratification with no thought of the future\nLack of responsibility and self-reliance\nPoor distribution of wealth\n\nIn order to understand these negative consequences better, please see the study by Shaykh Sami As-Suwaylim entitled Mawqif Al-Shari`ah Al-Islamiyyah min Al-Dayn (6-11)\nPermissible conditions for taking on debt in Islam\nBased on the above, the scholars have stipulated three conditions for debt to be permissible:\n\nThe borrower should be determined to repay it.\nIt should be known or thought most likely that he is able to repay it,\nIt should be for something that is permissible according to Shari`ah.\n\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Tamhid (23/238):\n“The debt for which a person will be kept out of Paradise – and Allah knows best – is that for which he left behind enough to pay it off but he did not leave instructions to that effect, or he was able to pay it off but did not do so, or he took the loan for some unlawful or extravagant matter and died without having paid it off.\nAs for the one who took a loan for something lawful because he was poor, and he died without leaving behind anything to pay it off, Allah will not keep him from Paradise because of it, in sha Allah.” (End quote)\nGuidance for those in debt\nSo long as you have taken on a debt so that you can fulfil the duty of helping your husband and family to pay for living expenses, you will be rewarded by Allah for this good deed. I ask Allah to reward you greatly for that. Remember that He will help you to pay off this debt.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who takes people`s wealth intending to pay it back, Allah will pay it back for him, and the one who takes it intending to destroy it, Allah will destroy him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2387)\nSeek help with that by working and striving hard to pay off the debt, and by putting your trust in Allah, and praying to Him to make it easy for you to pay off your debt.\nRecommended Du`as for seeking Allah’s help in paying off debts\nIn the Sunnah there are a number of Du`as which specifically seek the help of Allah in praying off debts. They are:\n\nIt was narrated that Suhayl (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Abu Salih used to tell us, when one of us wanted to sleep, to lie down on his right side and say:\n\n“Allahumma Rabb As-samawati wal-ard wa Rabb Al-`arsh il-`adhim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay`in, Faliq Al-habb wan-nawa wa munzil At-Tawrati wal-Injili wal-Furqan, a`udhu bika min sharri kulli shay`in anta akhidhun bi nasiyatihi. Allahumma anta Al-awwal fa laysa qablaka shay`un, wa anta Al-akhir fa laysa ba`daka shay`un, wa anta Adh-Dhahir fa laysa fawqaka shay`un wa anta Al-batin fa laysa dunaka shay`un. Iqdi `anna Ad-dayna wa aghnina min Al-faqri (O Allah, Lord of the seven heavens and the exalted Throne, our Lord and Lord of all things, splitter of the seed and the date-stone, Revealer of the Tawrat and the Injeel and the Furqan [Quran], I seek refuge in You from the evil of all things You shall seize by the forelock [have total mastery over]. O Allah, You are the First so there is nothing before You, and You are the Last so there is nothing after You. You are Adh-Dhahir [the greatest and highest] so there is nothing above You, and You are Al-Batin [aware of the subtlest secrets] so there is nothing closer than You. Settle our debt for us and spare us from poverty).”\nHe narrated that from Abu Hurayrah, from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Narrated by Muslim, 2713)\n\nIt was narrated from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that a Mukatib (slave who had entered into a contract of manumission) came to him and said: “I am unable to pay off my manumission; help me.” He said: “Shall I not tell you some words which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me? And if you have debt like the mountain of Seer, Allah will pay it off for you. He said: `Say: Allahumma akfini bi halalika `an haramika wa aghnini bi fadlika `amman siwaka (O Allah, suffice me with what You have permitted so that that I have no need of that which You have forbidden, and make me independent of means by Your bounty so that I have no need of anyone besides You).’” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2563. It was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi.)\n\n\xa0It was narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said:\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the mosque and saw an Ansari man whose name was Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him). He said: “O Abu Umamah, why do I see you sitting in the mosque when it is not the time for prayer? He said: Worries and debts, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Shall I not teach you some words which, if you say them, Allah will take away your worries and pay off your debts?” He said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said:\n“Say, morning and evening, `“Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min Al-hammi wal-hazani, wa a`udhi bika min Al-`ajzi wal-kasali, wa a`udhu bika min Al-jubni wal-bukhli, wa a`udhi bika min ghalabat il-dayn wa qahri Ar-rijal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from worry and grief, and I seek refuge with You from incapacity and laziness, and I seek refuge with You from cowardice and miserliness, and I seek refuge with You from being in debt and from being overcome by men).”\nHe said; I did that, and Allah took away my worry and paid off my debt. (Narrated by Abu Dawud (1555) Its chain of narration includes Ghassan ibn `Awf; Adh-Dhahabi said: he is not strong. Hence Shaykh Al-Albani classed the Hadith as inauthentic in Da`if Abu Dawud. But the Du`a mentioned – “Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min Al-hammi wal-hazani…” – is confirmed by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in a report other than this story of Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/71183/seriousness-of-debt-in-islam

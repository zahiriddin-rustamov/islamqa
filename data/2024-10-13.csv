131627,"Whilst reading about religious topics, I came across this sentence: “The grave will squeeze its occupant; if anyone were to be spared from that, Sa`d ibn Mu`adh would have been spared from it.” According to another report: “This is the one at whose death the Throne shook, the gates of heaven were opened for him and seventy thousand of the angels attended his funeral. He was squeezed once, then released.” Does this mean that Sa`d ibn Mu`adh was the only one among humanity who was spared from the squeezing of the grave? In other words, is the squeezing of the grave inevitable for every Muslim, even if he took measures to be spared from the punishment of the grave?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThe squeezing of the grave is the first thing that the deceased will experience in the realm of al-barzakh. This is affirmed in clear, authentic reports from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), including the following:\n-1-\nIt was narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“The grave will squeeze its occupant once, and if anyone were to be spared from it, Sa`d ibn Mu`adh would have been spared from it.”\nNarrated by Ahmad, 6/55, 98. Al-`Iraqi said in Takhrij al-Ihya, 5/259: Its isnad is good (jayyid). Adh-Dhahabi said in as-Siyar, 1/291: Its isnad is reliable. Al-Albani said in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah, 1695: To sum up, when all its isnads and corroborating reports are taken into account, the hadith is undoubtedly authentic. (End quote).\nThe commentators on Musnad Ahmad classed it as authentic (Mu’sasat ar-Risalah edn., 40/327)\n-2-\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said regarding Sa`d ibn Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) when he died:\n“This is the one at whose death the Throne shook, the gates of heaven were opened for him and seventy thousand of the angels attended his funeral. He was squeezed once, then released.”\nNarrated by an-Nasa’i in as-Sunan, 2055, 4/100. He said nothing about its isnad, and included it in a chapter entitled The squeezing and pressure of the grave. Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih an-Nasa’i.\n-3-\nIt was narrated from Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) that a child was buried, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said:\n“If anyone was to be spared from the squeezing of the grave, this child would be spared.”\nNarrated by at-Tabarani in al-Mu`jam al-Kabir, 4/121. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar classed a similar report as authentic in al-Matalib al-‘Aliyah, 13/44. Al-Haythami classed it as authentic in Majma` az-Zawa’id, 3/47. Al-Albani classed it as authentic in as-Silsilah as-Sahihah, no. 2164.\nIn at-Tadhkirah fi Ahwal al-Mawta wa Umur al-Akhirah, p. 323, under the chapter heading: What was narrated concerning the grave squeezing its occupant even if he was righteous, al-Qurtubi quoted other texts on this topic, but most of them are unreliable and odd.\nSimilarly, in al-Mawdu`at, 3/231, Ibn al-Jawzi narrated many of these reports under the chapter heading, The squeezing of the grave. But what we have mentioned of authentic reports is sufficient, in sha Allah.\nSecondly:\nThe scholars differed as to whether the believer will be subjected to the squeezing of the grave, and in what state he will be at that time. There are two views:\nThe first view:\nThe squeezing of the grave will happen to every believer and it will be intense, but the righteous believer will be released quickly and his grave will be made spacious for him, so this torment will not last for a long time. As for the evildoer, the squeezing will be intense in his case and the constriction of his grave will last longer, commensurate with his sin and disobedience.\nAbu’l-Qasim as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNo one, whether he was righteous or an evildoer, will be spared from the squeezing of the grave, but the difference between the Muslim and the disbeliever in this regard is how long the squeezing will last. It will last for a long time in the case of the disbeliever, whereas for the believer, this squeezing will happen when he is first placed in his grave, then his grave will become spacious again. (End quote)\nAl-Hakim at-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe reason for this squeezing is that there is no one who did not commit sin, so this squeezing will be like a punishment for his sin, then the Mercy of Allah will save him from it. (End quote from Hashiyat as-Suyuti ‘ala Sunan an-Nasa’i, 3/292. Ar-Ramli quoted it in his Fatawa, 4/210)\nThe second view: The squeezing of the grave will happen to righteous Muslims, but it will be a gentle and compassionate squeezing, with no pain or suffering. As for the sinful Muslims, the squeezing will be intense in their case, by way of wrath, commensurate with their sins and bad deeds.\nIt was narrated that Muhammad at-Taymi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nHe used to say that the squeezing of the grave happens because the earth is like their mother and from it they were created, then they were away from it for a long time. So when its children return to it, it embraces them like a compassionate mother whose children were away from her, then they returned to her. Whoever was obedient to Allah, it will squeeze him with gentleness and kindness, but whoever was disobedient to Allah, it will squeeze him with force, because it is angry with him.\nAs-Suyuti narrated it in Hashiyat as-Suyuti ‘ala Sunan an-Nasa’i, 3/292, from the report of Ibn Abi Dunya. He [as-Suyuti] also quoted it in Bushra al-Ka’ib bi Liqa’ al-Habib, p. 5, under the chapter heading: The squeezing of the earth will be gentle for the believer.\nA marfu` hadith regarding this matter was narrated from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), in which she said: O Messenger of Allah, yesterday you told me about the voices of Munkar and Nakir and the squeezing of the grave, and it upset me greatly.\nHe said: “O `A’ishah, the voices of Munkar and Nakir in the ears of the believers are like antimony in the eye, and the squeezing of the grave for the believer is like the compassionate embrace of a mother whose child complains of a headache, so she presses his head gently. But, O `A’ishah, woe to those who doubt Allah, for they will be squeezed in their graves like an egg on a rock.”\nNarrated by al-Bayhaqi in Ithbat `Adhab al-Qabr, p. 85, no. 116, and by ad-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, no. 3776. Its isnad includes al-Hasan ibn Abi Ja`far and `Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad`an, both of whom are unreliable, so it is an unreliable hadith. Some of them attributed it to Ibn Mandah and Ibn an-Najjar, but I have not come across it.\nAl-Hafiz adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis squeezing has nothing to do with the torment of the grave; rather it is something that the believer will feel, just as a person feels the pain of losing his child or his close friend in this world, and as he feels pain when he is sick, pain when his soul is taken, pain when he is being questioned and tested in his grave, pain when hearing his family weep for him, pain when being resurrected from his grave, pain and horror in the place of standing, pain when passing over hell, and so on. He may suffer from all of these frightening things, but they are not the torment of the grave or the torment of hell at all. Rather Allah will alleviate some or all of that for the righteous person, but the believer will have no rest until he meets his Lord. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Day of Regret}\n[Maryam 19:39]\n{And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Approaching Day, when hearts will be at the throats}\n[Ghafir 40:18].\nWe ask Allah, may He be exalted, to forgive us and care for us. Yet despite all these difficult experiences, Sa`d ibn Mu`adh is one of those who we know to be one of the people of Paradise, and we know that he is one of the highest in status of the martyrs (may Allah be pleased with them). It is as if you think that the victorious one will not go through any trials in this world or the hereafter, and he will not go through any terror, pain or fear! Ask your Lord for well-being, and ask Him to gather us with the group in which Sa`d will be. (End quote from A`lam an-Nubala’, 1/290-292)\nShaykh an-Nafrawi al-Maliki said:\nWith regard to the squeezing of the grave, it is inevitable, but it will vary according to the differences in people’s status. (End quote from al-Fawakih ad-Dawani, 2/688)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThis hadith – the hadith “The grave squeezed Sa`d once” – is well known to the scholars. Assuming it is authentic, the earth’s squeezing of the believer will be an embrace of mercy and compassion, like a mother embracing her child. As for its squeezing of the disbeliever, it will be a squeezing of pain and torment – Allah forbid. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us that when a person is buried, two angels come to him and ask him about three fundamental matters: Who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is your prophet? The believer says: My Lord is Allah, my religion is Islam and my prophet is Muhammad. I ask Allah to make this my answer and your answer. As for the hypocrite or the apostate – may Allah protect us and you from that – he will say: Oh, oh, I do not know; I heard the people say something so I said it too. Then the grave will squeeze him until his ribs interlock – Allah forbid – due to the severity of the squeezing. So there is a difference between the way in which the earth will squeeze the disbeliever or apostate and the way in which it will squeeze the believer. (End quote from Liqa’at al-Bab al-Maftuh, no. 161, question no. 17).\nWhat appears to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that the first view is the more likely to be correct regarding this issue, because of what is clearly indicated by the hadith, and that no one among the believers, let alone others, will be spared from the squeezing of the grave. This is indicative of how difficult this squeezing will be, and that it will cause pain to the one who is squeezed in his grave, even though people will vary in that, each according to his deeds and his situation. Because of that, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) described the squeezing of the grave as one of the means of attaining forgiveness of sins. He said: … The eighth means is what will happen in the grave of testing, squeezing and terror, for these are things that bring about expiation of sins. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 7/500).\nHowever, the hadith mentioned in the question does not indicate that Sa`d is the only one who was spared from the squeezing of the grave, as the questioner thinks. Rather it says that Sa`d (may Allah be pleased with him) was not spared from the squeezing of the grave, although he was the most deserving of being spared, if anyone was to be spared.\nSee also the answer to question no. 71175.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/131627/will-anyone-be-spared-from-the-squeezing-in-the-grave
70530,Is it possible when doing Wudu to wipe a small part of the head at the back and not at the front?,"['Praise be to Allah.Is wiping the hair mandatory in Wudu?\nThe Muslims unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to wipe the head when doing Wudu, because Allah Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! When you intend to offer the prayer, wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles.}\xa0[Al-Ma’idah 5:6]\nIs Wiping Part of the Head Enough in Wudu?\nThe jurists agreed that it is best to wipe the entire head, but they differed as to whether doing so is obligatory or not.\xa0The Malikis and Hanbalis are of the view that it is obligatory to wipe the entire head. The Hanafis and Shafi`is are of the view that it is sufficient to wipe part of the head.\nThe Malikis and Hanbalis quoted a number of things as evidence:\n\nAllah Says (interpretation of the meaning): {rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads} which includes the entire head.\n\nThis verse – “rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads” – refers to the entire head and it is like the phrase in which Allah says concerning Tayammum (interpretation of the meaning): {then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands.} [Al-Ma’idah 5:6] The entire face must be wiped in Tayammum, and the same applies to the head in this case.\xa0(End quote from Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 21/125)\nIbn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe jurists differed concerning the one who wipes part of the head. Malik said: What must be done is to wipe the entire head, and if he omits part of it then he is like one who fails to wash part of his face. This is the well-known view in the Madhhab of Malik, and it is also the view of Ibn `Uliyyah. Ibn `Uliyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah commanded us to wipe the head in Wudu as He commanded us to wipe the face in Tayammum and to wash it in Wudu. They unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to wash only part of the face in Wudu or to wipe only part of it in Tayammum. The same applies to wiping the head. (End quote from At-Tamhid, 20/114)\n\nThey quoted as evidence the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for there is a proven report of him wiping only part of his head.\n\nThe Hanafis and Shafi`is also quoted evidence, including the following:\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning): {rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads [wa’msahu bi ru’usikum]} – the Ba’ (before the word ru’usikum (heads)) indicates something partial, as if He were saying: “Wash part of your heads.”\n\nMy response to that is to note that the Ba’ does not indicate something partial, rather it refers to making something stick, i.e., it is obligatory to make some of the water with which one is wiping the head stick to the head.\xa0(End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 21/123)\n\nThe report narrated by Muslim (247) from Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wiped his forelock and his turban. They said: He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only wiped the forelock, which is at the front of the head.\n\nThe response to that is that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wiped his forelock and completed the wiping over his turban, and wiping the turban took the place of wiping over the head.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad Al-Ma`ad (1/193): There is no sound report in a single Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ever wiped over only part of his head. But if he wiped over his forelock, he completed the wiping by wiping over his turban. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Wiping over the forelock was sufficient here because he also wiped over the turban at the same time. So this does not indicate that it is permissible to wipe over the forelock only. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/178)\nThus it seems that the more correct of the two views is the view that it is obligatory to wipe over the entire head when doing Wudu.\nIt says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (5/227):\nIt is obligatory to wipe over the entire head when doing Wudu, because Allah Says “rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads”, and because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from `Abdullah ibn Zayd ibn `Asim (may Allah be pleased with him) describing Wudu, in which he said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wiped his head, moving his hands forwards and backwards.” According to another version: “He started at the front of his head until he moved them (his hands) to the back, then he brought them back to the place where he had started.” (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (1/187): If he wipes the forelock only and not the rest of the head, that is not sufficient, because Allah says: “rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:6] And He did not say, “part of your heads.” (End quote)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/70530/is-wiping-part-of-the-head-enough-in-wudu
340807,"What is the bliss that the people of al-Firdaws will enjoy, to the exclusion of the people in the other levels of Paradise? I do not mean what kind of people will enter it; rather I mean bliss in terms of rivers, palaces, al-hur al-iyn and so on, and their seeing the blessed Countenance of Allah. How does this type of bliss differ from that of the other levels?","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Firdaws is one of the names of Paradise\nOne of the names of Paradise is al-Firdaws. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those are the inheritors\nWho will inherit al-Firdaws. They will abide therein eternally}\xa0[al-Mu’minun 23:10-11]\n{Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds – they will have the Gardens of Paradise [jannat al-firdaws] as a lodging as a dwelling place}\xa0[al-Kahf 18:107].\nAl-Firdaws is a name given to all of Paradise, and it was said that it is a name given to the best and loftiest part of it, as if that part is more deserving of this name than the rest of Paradise. (End quote from Hadi al-Arwah, 99)\nSecondly:\nAl-Firdaws is the highest of the levels of Paradise\nAt-Tirmidhi, 2450, narrated, and classed the report as sound, that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is worried about reaching his destination on time will set out at night, and the one who sets out at night will reach his destination. Indeed what Allah is offering is precious; indeed what Allah is offering is Paradise.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih at-Tirmidhi and elsewhere.\nParadise is a precious thing, and al-Firdaws is the loftiest and best part of it. No one will reach it except those on whom Allah chooses to bestow additional blessing and grace.\nAt-Tirmidhi, 2450, narrated, and classed the report as authentic, from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Firdaws is the elevated part of Paradise, the middle of it and the best part of it.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Paradise is surrounded with hardships and Hell is surrounded with desires.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nIf Paradise is surrounded with hardships and all kinds of difficulties, then how about the highest and most sublime part of it?\nThis indicates that reaching it is no easy matter.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe most sublime thing in existence, the purest, most luminous, noblest, highest in elevation and in esteem, and the vastest is the Throne of the Most Gracious, may He be glorified and exalted. Hence it was fit for Him to rise above it, and the closer anything is to the Throne, the more luminous, sublime and noble it is than that which is further away from it. Hence Jannat al-Firdaws is the highest part of Paradise, the noblest, most luminous and greatest part of it, because of its proximity to the Throne, for the Throne is its roof.\nThe further away a thing is from the Throne, the darker and more constricted it is. Hence the lowest level of Hell is the worst of places, the most constricted and the furthest away from all that is good. (End quote from al-Fawa’id, p. 27)\nThe people of al-Firdaws al-A`la will be the forerunners, those who hasten to do good deeds as they are commanded. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{And the foremost are the foremost;\nit is they who will be brought near to Allah,\nin gardens of delight }\xa0[al-Waqi`ah 56:10-12].\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those who are brought near to Allah are the elite of creation. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa`di, p. 833).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThose who are foremost in doing good in this world will, in the hereafter, be foremost in honour, for the reward will match the deed, and a person will reap what he sows. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7/517)\nAl-Firdaws is the highest of the levels of Paradise; we ask Allah of His grace and bounty.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 135085 and 27075.\nThirdly:\nThe people of Paradise will vary in status and level\nIn the Quran, Allah, may He be exalted, has mentioned different types of people in several places, and has described in detail the bliss of those who go ahead of others. Those places include what is mentioned in Surat ar-Rahman, Surat al-Waqi`ah and other surahs of the Holy Quran.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us about the variations in the level and status of the people of Paradise. It was narrated from Abu Sa`id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will see the people of the chambers above them as you see a brilliant star far away on the horizon in the east or the west, because of the difference in status between them.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, is that the status of the prophets that no one else will attain? He said: “No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul. They are men who believed in Allah and believed in the Messengers.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3256, and Muslim, 2831)\nIt was narrated that al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah told the people from the minbar –attributing it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – “Moosa asked his Lord: ‘Who will be the lowest of the people of Paradise in status?’ He said: ‘He will be a man who will come after the people of Paradise have been admitted to Paradise and it will be said to him: “Enter Paradise.” He will say: “O Lord, how, when the people have taken their places and have received that with which they have been honoured?” It will be said to him: “Would it please you if you had the like of what one of the kings of the world had?” He will say: “I would be pleased, O Lord.” He will say, “You will have that, and as much again, and as much again, and as much again, and as much again.” The fifth time, he will say, “I am pleased, O Lord.” He will say: “You will have that and ten times as much, and you will have what your heart desires and what will delight your eyes.” He will say: “I am pleased, O Lord.”’ (Moosa) said: ‘My Lord, who will be the highest of them in status?’ He said, ‘They will be the ones whom I have chosen; I have guaranteed their honour and reward Myself and set a seal over it, and no eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has it entered the heart of man.’” He said: And the confirmation thereof is in the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted: {No soul knows what is kept hidden in store for them of delight} [al-Sajdah 32:17].\n(Narrated by Muslim, 189)\nThe people of the highest level will enjoy bliss that is more sublime than that of those below them. Allah has stated that He has prepared for those who fear Him two gardens: {For him who fears standing before his Lord there will be two gardens} [ar-Rahman 55:46]. He describes them, then He says: {And below them both are two [other] gardens} [ar-Rahman 55:62 –that is, they will be lower than the first two gardens in status. The one who reflects on the characteristics of the second pair of gardens that Allah mentions will realize that they are lower than the first two in status, so the first two are for those who are close to Allah, and the others are for the people of the right (as-hab al-yamin).\nSee: al-Jannah wa’n-Nar by `Umar al-Ashqar, 158.\nWe have not come across any details of what Allah has prepared for the people of al-Firdaws of eternal bliss therein, other than what we already know, which is that it is the highest level of the people of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the Most Gracious, may He be glorified and exalted.\nIt is soundly narrated in the hadith from `Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are one hundred levels. The distance between each two levels is like the distance between heaven and earth. Al-Fidaws is the highest of these levels; from it spring the four rivers of Paradise and above it is the Throne. So when you ask of Allah, ask Him for al-Firdaws.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 22738, and at-Tirmidhi, 2531.

71359,Which surah of Al-Quran when recited is equal to reciting 1/2 Al-Quran?,"['Praise be to Allah.Analyzing Hadiths about the Virtue of Surat Az-Zalzalah\nThere are many Hadiths which speak of the virtue of certain Surahs of the Quran, some of which are authentic, but many of them are inauthentic. That includes the Hadith which speaks of the virtue of Surat Az-Zalzalah and says that it is equivalent to half of the Quran. A number of Munkar (inauthentic) Hadiths were narrated concerning that. They are as follows:\nExamining the First Hadith\n\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “ `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ (i.e., Surat Az-Zalzalah) is equivalent to half of the Quran.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2894 and Al-Hakim, 1/754)\n\nIts chain of narration includes Yaman ibn Al-Mughirah Al-`Anzi, concerning whom Al-Bukhari and Abu Hatim said: his Hadith is Munkar. Ibn Hibban said: his Hadith is very Munkar; he narrates Munkar Hadiths that have no basis and deserve to be ignored. (Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, 4/452)\nYaman is the only one who narrated this Hadith, alone among the companions of `Ata’, and he is not acceptable as a sole narrator of a Hadith, rather the fact that he is the sole narrator indicates that it is Munkar. And Allah knows best.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that the Hadith is to be regarded as weak because of Yaman ibn Al-Mughirah, in contrast to those scholars who classed it as authentic. It was classed as inauthentic by At-Tirmidhi when he said, after quoting it: it is Gharib and we know it only from the Hadith of Yaman ibn Al-Mughirah. It was also classed as such by Ibn `Abd Al-Barr in At-Tamhid, where he said: It is one of the Hadiths of the Shaykhs, not one of the Hadiths of the imams. And it was classed as inauthentic by Ibn Hajar in Fat-h Al-Bari (8/687), by Adh-Dhahabi in Talkhis Al-Mustadrak, by Al-Manawi in Fayd Al-Qadir (1/367) and by As-Shawkani in Al-Fat-h Ar-Rabbani (12/5930). Al-Albani said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1342): it is Munkar.\nExamining the Second Hadith\n\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’, it will be equivalent to half of the Quran for him.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2893)\n\nIts chain of narration includes Al-Hasan ibn Salim Al-`Ajali. Al-Mizzi said: He is a Shaykh who is unknown and recited only one Hadith. Al-`Aqili said: He is unknown with regard to transmitting Hadith. Ibn Hibban said: he narrates from trustworthy narrators things that do not sound right.\xa0(Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, 1/396)\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that this Hadith is also to be regarded as inauthentic. It was classed as inauthentic by At-Tirmidhi when he said, after quoting it: It is Gharib. Al-`Aqili said: It is not known, as stated in Tahdhib At-Tahdhib (1/396). It was also classed as inauthentic by Ibn Hibban in Al-Majruhin (1/279), and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman (2/497). Adh-Dhahabi said in Mizan Al-I`tidal (1/523): it is Munkar. Al-Albani said likewise in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1342)\nExamining the Third Hadith\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ in one night, it will be equivalent to half of the Quran for him.” (Narrated by Ibn As-Sunni in `Aml Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, 691)\n\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1342): It was narrated by Abu Umayah At-Tarsusi in Musnad Abu Hurayrah (2/195), but its chain of narration is very weak; it includes `Isa ibn Maymun Al-Madani, who was classed as inauthentic by a number of scholars. Abu Hatim and others said: His Hadith is to be rejected. (End quote)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nata’ij Al-Afkar (3/268): Its chain of narration includes a narrator who is very weak. (End quote)\nFrom the above it is clear that there is no authentic report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about Surat Az-Zalzalah being equivalent to half of the Quran. But it seems that some of the imams of the Salaf followed this Hadith and, based on their own Ijtihad, stated that the important meanings that are contained in this Surah are equivalent to half of the principles that the Quran referred to.\nIt says in Musannaf `Abd Ar-Razzaq (3/372): It was narrated that Ma`mar said: I heard a man narrating that `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ is equivalent to half of the Quran.\nIt was narrated from Ja`far that Hisham ibn Muslim said: I heard Bakr ibn `Abdullah Al-Muzani say: ‘When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ is half of the Quran.\nAbu `Ubayd narrated a Mursal report from Al-Hasan Al-Basri: “ `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ is equivalent to half of the Quran, and `By the (steeds) that run’ (Surat Al-`Adiyat) is equivalent to half of the Quran.”\xa0 (End quote from Al-Itqan by As-Suyuti, 2/413)\nIt was narrated that `Asim ibn Abu An-Nujud Al-Imam Al-Muqri’ (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt was said that whoever recites ‘When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ it is as if he has recited half of the Quran.\nIbn Hajar said in Nata’ij Al-Afkar (3/270): its men are trustworthy.\nAl-Manawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fayd Al-Qadir (1/367):\nBecause the greatest objective of the Quran is to explain the creation and the resurrection, and ‘When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ refers only to the resurrection, therefore it is equivalent to half of the Quran. This was referred to by Al-Qadi. \xa0(End quote)\nThis is the Ijtihad (the exertion of a Muslim jurist’S best intellectual effort to derive legal rulingsS from Islamic sources when clearcut texts are not available) of some of the Salaf, and it is not permissible to attribute it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It does not mean that it is equivalent to half of the Quran in terms of reward.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 90186, 75894, 2241, 132386, 10538, 114281.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/71359/which-surah-is-equal-to-half-of-the-quran

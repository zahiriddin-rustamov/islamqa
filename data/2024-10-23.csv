262489,A – Loan Taker.,"['Praise be to Allah.First: The lender paying Zakah on the debt owed to him has some details:\n\nIf the debt is owed by a wealthy person who is able to pay and acknowledges the debt, the lender must pay Zakah on it.\nIf the debt is owed by an insolvent person or someone who denies the debt, the lender is not obligated to pay Zakah on it until he receives it. Then he pays Zakah on it once.\n\nPlease see the answer to question number (125854).\nSecond: It is permissible for the lender to say to the debtor: Give what you owe to such and such poor person, intending it as Zakah, if the debt is present with the debtor and he has offered it to its owner. This falls under delegating the payment of Zakah, as if the lender received his debt and then gave it to the poor person.\nAs-Sarakhsi (may Allah have mercy on him)\xa0said: “If he gives it in charity to another poor person and orders him to receive it from him, intending it as his Zakah, it is sufficient for him. This is because that poor person is his agent in receiving it, as if he received it himself and then gave it in charity to him, intending it as his Zakah. Similarly, if he receives it and then gives it in charity to the debtor, intending it as his Zakah, it is sufficient if he is poor, just as if he gave it in charity to someone else. If he is rich and he knows that, it does not count as Zakah and he is liable for the Zakah on this thousand.” (Al-Mabsut, 3/36)\nBut does the debtor have the choice – as mentioned in the question – between giving it to the poor person or keeping it for himself? The answer: No, and there are three scenarios for this:\nFirst: If the lender specifies a poor person to whom the Zakah should be given, the debtor cannot give it to anyone else.\nSecond: If he does not specify a poor person and allows the debtor to take the Zakah for himself, this is waiving the debt and counting it as Zakah, which is not allowed.\nIt is stated in “Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah” (23/300): “It is not permissible for the creditor to waive his debt from his poor, insolvent debtor who has nothing to pay his debt with, and count it as part of his Zakah. If he does so, it does not count as Zakah. This is the opinion of the Hanafi, Hanbali, and Maliki schools except for Ashhab, and it is the most correct view according to the Shafi`i school, and the opinion of Abu `Ubayd.”\nThe reason for prohibition is that Zakat is a right of Allah Almighty. Therefore, it is not permissible for a person to spend it on benefiting himself, reviving his wealth, or fulfilling his debt. The Shafi’is in one opinion, Ashhab from the Malikis, and it is narrated from Al-Hasan Al-Basri and `Ata’: It is permissible because if he gave him his Zakat and then took it back for his debt, it would be permissible, so this is the same.\nIf the creditor pays the Zakat of his wealth to his debtor, and the debtor returns it to him to settle his debt, or if the debtor borrows what he needs to pay off his debt, gives it to the creditor, and the creditor returns it to him and counts it as Zakat, then if this is not a trick, collusion, or intended to revive his wealth: it is permissible according to the majority, and it is an opinion of the Malikis.\nThe third scenario: The lender does not specify a poor person, nor does he give permission to the debtor. Rather, the debtor takes it for himself without his knowledge. If he is not eligible for Zakat, this is a betrayal that is not permissible. If he is eligible, the majority opinion is that it is prohibited for the agent distributing Zakat to take it for himself. Please see: Tabyin Al-Haqa’iq (1/305), Kashshaf Al-Qina` (3/363). Please see the answer to question number (49899).\nIt is clear here that the lender intended to deliver the Zakah to a poor person other than the debtor. If he had intended it for the debtor, it would not have been permissible, as mentioned in the second scenario. This clarifies that it is not permissible for the debtor to keep the money for himself, even if he is eligible for Zakah.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/262489/if-the-lender-tells-the-debtor-to-give-what-he-owes-to-a-poor-person-as-zakah-is-it-permissible-for-him-to-keep-the-money-for-himself
47682,Is it permissible to Call the Adhan in a Singing Tone?,"['Praise be to Allah.It is disliked to sing the Adhan in the sense of elongating the words excessively without changing the meaning. If the meaning is changed, then it becomes prohibited and the Adhan is not correct in this\xa0case.\nIbn Abi Shaybah (259) narrated that a Mu’adhdhin gave the Adhan and elongated the words in his Adhan and made it sound like singing. `Umar ibn `Abd Al-`Aziz (may Allah have mercy on him) said to him: Give a gentle Adhan otherwise keep away from us.\nWhat is meant by a gentle Adhan is one without singing it.\xa0(End quote from Al-Maghrib fi Lughat Al-Fiqh by Abu Al-Makarim Al-Matrazi Al-Hanafi, p 234)\nIt says in Al-Mudawwanah (1/159):\nMalik regarded it as disliked to sing the Adhan and disliked that intensely.\nImam Ash-Shafi`i said in Al-Umm (1/107):\nI like the Adhan to be recited clearly without elongating any words or rushing it.\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah:\nThe jurists agreed that elongating the words of the Adhan and singing it and adding any elongation or letter at the beginning or the end is disliked, because it is contrary to proper focus and dignity. But if the singing and elongation\xa0changes the meaning then it is prohibited and there is no scholarly dispute on this point, because it was narrated that a man said to Ibn `Umar: “I love you for the sake of Allah.” He said: “I hate you for the sake of Allah, for you sing the Adhan.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the Adhan that is sung, this means giving the Adhan with a tune as if singing a song. It is valid but it is disliked.\nAnd he said: But making grammatical mistakes in the Adhan falls into two categories, one which renders the Adhan invalid, which is when the meaning is changed, and one in which the Adhan is valid but is disliked, which is when the meaning is not changed. For example, if the Mu’adhdhin says “Allahu akbar” (elongating the `a’ sound), this is not valid because it changes the meaning, because Akbar is the plural of Kabar, which is a type of drum.\xa0(End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/62)\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Excessive elongation is not appropriate, and if the vowels are elongated to such an extent that the meaning is changed, this is not valid, otherwise it is disliked. (End quote from Fatawa Ash-Shaykh, 1/125)\nThe point is that singing the Adhan is disliked, and may render the Adhan invalid if it changes the meaning.\nFor more details, please see the following answers:\nModulation and elongation of vowels in the Adhan\nMeaning of taghanni in Quran recitation\nIs exaggerating in beautifying the voice when leading people in prayer regarded as showing off?\nRuling on using auto-tune and vocal effects for the Quran\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47682/is-it-permissible-to-call-the-adhan-in-a-singing-tone
342517,"I live in Finland and want to buy a house. In Finland, when you buy an apartment what you are actually buying are shares in a housing company(cooperative). Owning shares in a housing company, corresponding to “one apartment”, is considered as “owning your own home” in Finland. A housing company is a legal and nonprofit entity that owns many residential buildings. The housing company is owned and managed by the residents. The housing company is responsible for the maintenance of buildings and common areas. The buyer pays a small monthly maintenance fee to the company which covers heating, water, upkeep of the common areas, staff salary etc. For major renovations, such as pipe renovation which is very expensive and done once every 50 years, housing companies often take loans from banks. Depending upon the apartment size every apartment owner has to pay a part of the loan through monthly payments to the company. An apartment owner can also choose to make a one-off payment of his part of the loan to the company. Is it halal to buy a house or apartment in a housing cooperative as purchasing an apartment is actually buying shares in the housing company which can take interest-based loans from banks for major renovations. Alternative option is to buy a standalone house which common people usually cannot afford to buy through cash.","['Praise be to Allah.First: It is not permissible for a housing company to borrow with Riba (interest/usury). It is also not permissible to invest in this company as long as it borrows with Riba. This is because the company acts as an agent for the shareholders in its dealings. Therefore, the shareholders bear the sin of any prohibited actions the company undertakes if they are aware of them.\nBorrowing with Riba is one of the major sins. Severe warnings and declarations of war from Allah and His Messenger have been issued regarding it, unlike any other sin.\nAllah Says (translation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers. And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal – [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged} [Al-Baqarah 278-279].\nMuslim (1598) narrated from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) cursed the one who consumes Riba (interest/usury), the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: (They are all the same).”\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (3/241): “Muslims have unanimously agreed, based on\xa0narrations from their Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), that stipulating an increase in a loan is Riba, even if it were a handful of fodder – as Ibn Mas`ud said – or a single grain.”\nSecondly: In many cases, the reality of this transaction is that the buyer purchases his apartment from the housing company, and the company connects him with a bank to pay the price of the apartment in cash on his behalf, and he repays it in installments with an increase. This is common in government and community housing projects. Here, the borrower is the owner of the apartment, and this is more reprehensible and severe than the case where the loan is in the name of the housing company, and both are prohibited.\nThirdly: It is prohibited to purchase apartments through Riba, regardless of the form of the transaction. The high cost of housing is not considered a necessity that permits Riba. A person should limit themselves to renting until Allah grants them ease.\nAmong the permissible alternatives is to search for someone who buys the apartment and then sells it to you. Some banks and investment companies do this, where the bank buys the apartment, receives it, and then sells it in installments. For more information, please see the answer to question number (110006).\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/342517/the-ruling-on-buying-an-apartment-from-a-cooperative-housing-company-with-bank-financing
46531,Only recently did I know that the Prophet (Peace and Blessings be upon him) urged us to read Surat Al-Mulk to protect us from the punishment of the grave. But I also heard that if you read Surat Al-Muzamil you will become wealthy (rich). Are there any authentic Hadiths to prove this being said from our blessed Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Examining the Fabricated Hadiths on Virtues of Surat Al-Muzzammil\nWhat you have read about the virtues of reading Surat Al-Muzzammil is not correct, rather it is a fabricated Hadith and it is not permissible to follow it or take it as evidence.\nIt was originally narrated from Zirr ibn Hubaysh from Ubayy ibn Ka`b (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the Quran to me twice during the year in which he died, and said: “Jibril (peace be upon him) told me to recite the Quran to you, and he sends greetings of Salam to you.” Ubayy said: I said when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited to me: “It is as if it was just for me; did you single me out for the reward of Quran because of what Allah told you?” He said: “Yes, O Ubayy. Any Muslim who recites the Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah) will be given as much reward as if he recited two-thirds of the Quran, and he will be given reward as if he had given charity to every believer, man and woman… and whoever recites Surat Al-Muzzammil will be relieved of hardship in this world and in the Hereafter.”\nScholarly Opinions on the Hadith\nIbn Al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: And he mentioned a reward for every Surah until the end of the Quran… this Hadith about the virtues of the Surahs is undoubtedly fabricated. (End quote from Al-Mawdu`at, 1/391)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This was narrated by Al-`Aqili from Ubayy ibn Ka`b in a Marfu` report (i.e., attributed to the Prophet). Ibn Al-Mubarak said: I think that the Zanadiqah fabricated it.\nThe Hadith has several chains of narrations all of which are false and fabricated… and there is no dispute among the scholars that this Hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka`b is fabricated. A number of Quran commentators were deceived by it and mentioned it in their books of Tafsir such as Ath-Tha`labi, Al-Wahidi and Az-Zamakhshari. No wonder, because they were not versed in this area of knowledge. (End quote from Al-Fawa`id Al-Majmu`ah fi Al-Ahadith Al-Mawdu`ah, p. 264)\nThe fact that this Hadith is false was mentioned by Ibn `Adi in Al-Kamil (7/2588) and by As-Suyuti in Al-La`ali’ Al-Masnu`ah (1/227) and by Al-Dhahabi in Tartib Al-Mawdu`at, 60, and by others.\nNote: Many Hadiths were fabricated about the virtues of various Surahs of the Quran. Their fabricators` intention was to encourage people to read Quran and devote themselves to that, and they claimed that they were doing good thereby.\nBut their intentions were misguided because that is undoubtedly subject to the stern warning contained in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 10; Muslim, 4) It makes no difference whether the lie is intended for good or for evil.\nMu’ammil ibn Isma`il (d. 206 AH) investigated this Hadith until he found the person who admitted to fabricating it. Mu’ammil said: A Shaykh told me this Hadith and I said to him: Who narrated this to you? He said: A man in Al-Mada`in, who is still alive. So I traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said: A Shaykh in Wasit. So I traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said: A Shaykh in Basrah. So I traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said:\xa0 A Shaykh in `Abadan. So I traveled to go and see him, and he took me by the hand and led me into a house, where there were some Sufi people and a Shaykh with them, and he said: This is the Shaykh who narrated it to me. I said: O Shaykh, who narrated this to you? He said: No one narrated it to me; rather we saw that the people had turned away from the Qur`an, so we fabricated this Hadith for them, to turn their hearts back to the Quran.\nAnother example is the Hadith of `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) concerning the virtues of the Quran Surah by Surah. Its fabricator, Nuh ibn Abu Maryam, was asked about it and he said: I saw that the people had turned away from the Quran and were preoccupied with the fiqh of Abu Hanifah and the Maghazi of Muhammad ibn Is-haq, so I fabricated these Hadiths for the sake of Allah.\xa0(Al-Mawdu`at by Ibn Al-Jawzi, 1/394; Sharh Muqaddimah Ibn As-Salah by Al-`Iraqi, 111)\nWith regard to Surat Al-Mulk, we have already discussed its virtues in question no\xa026240.\nMay Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 6460, 82800, 45839, 222887, 90186, 2241, 71359.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46531/any-virtues-of-surat-al-muzzammil

342517,"I live in Finland and want to buy a house. In Finland, when you buy an apartment what you are actually buying are shares in a housing company(cooperative). Owning shares in a housing company, corresponding to “one apartment”, is considered as “owning your own home” in Finland. A housing company is a legal and nonprofit entity that owns many residential buildings. The housing company is owned and managed by the residents. The housing company is responsible for the maintenance of buildings and common areas. The buyer pays a small monthly maintenance fee to the company which covers heating, water, upkeep of the common areas, staff salary etc. For major renovations, such as pipe renovation which is very expensive and done once every 50 years, housing companies often take loans from banks. Depending upon the apartment size every apartment owner has to pay a part of the loan through monthly payments to the company. An apartment owner can also choose to make a one-off payment of his part of the loan to the company. Is it halal to buy a house or apartment in a housing cooperative as purchasing an apartment is actually buying shares in the housing company which can take interest-based loans from banks for major renovations. Alternative option is to buy a standalone house which common people usually cannot afford to buy through cash.","['Praise be to Allah.First: It is not permissible for a housing company to borrow with Riba (interest/usury). It is also not permissible to invest in this company as long as it borrows with Riba. This is because the company acts as an agent for the shareholders in its dealings. Therefore, the shareholders bear the sin of any prohibited actions the company undertakes if they are aware of them.\nBorrowing with Riba is one of the major sins. Severe warnings and declarations of war from Allah and His Messenger have been issued regarding it, unlike any other sin.\nAllah Says (translation of the meaning): {O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers. And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal – [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged} [Al-Baqarah 278-279].\nMuslim (1598) narrated from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) cursed the one who consumes Riba (interest/usury), the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: (They are all the same).”\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (3/241): “Muslims have unanimously agreed, based on\xa0narrations from their Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), that stipulating an increase in a loan is Riba, even if it were a handful of fodder – as Ibn Mas`ud said – or a single grain.”\nSecondly: In many cases, the reality of this transaction is that the buyer purchases his apartment from the housing company, and the company connects him with a bank to pay the price of the apartment in cash on his behalf, and he repays it in installments with an increase. This is common in government and community housing projects. Here, the borrower is the owner of the apartment, and this is more reprehensible and severe than the case where the loan is in the name of the housing company, and both are prohibited.\nThirdly: It is prohibited to purchase apartments through Riba, regardless of the form of the transaction. The high cost of housing is not considered a necessity that permits Riba. A person should limit themselves to renting until Allah grants them ease.\nAmong the permissible alternatives is to search for someone who buys the apartment and then sells it to you. Some banks and investment companies do this, where the bank buys the apartment, receives it, and then sells it in installments.

46531,Only recently did I know that the Prophet (Peace and Blessings be upon him) urged us to read Surat Al-Mulk to protect us from the punishment of the grave. But I also heard that if you read Surat Al-Muzamil you will become wealthy (rich). Are there any authentic Hadiths to prove this being said from our blessed Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)?,"['Praise be to Allah.Examining the Fabricated Hadiths on Virtues of Surat Al-Muzzammil\nWhat you have read about the virtues of reading Surat Al-Muzzammil is not correct, rather it is a fabricated Hadith and it is not permissible to follow it or take it as evidence.\nIt was originally narrated from Zirr ibn Hubaysh from Ubayy ibn Ka`b (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the Quran to me twice during the year in which he died, and said: “Jibril (peace be upon him) told me to recite the Quran to you, and he sends greetings of Salam to you.” Ubayy said: I said when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited to me: “It is as if it was just for me; did you single me out for the reward of Quran because of what Allah told you?” He said: “Yes, O Ubayy. Any Muslim who recites the Opening of the Book (Al-Fatihah) will be given as much reward as if he recited two-thirds of the Quran, and he will be given reward as if he had given charity to every believer, man and woman… and whoever recites Surat Al-Muzzammil will be relieved of hardship in this world and in the Hereafter.”\nScholarly Opinions on the Hadith\nIbn Al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: And he mentioned a reward for every Surah until the end of the Quran… this Hadith about the virtues of the Surahs is undoubtedly fabricated. (End quote from Al-Mawdu`at, 1/391)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This was narrated by Al-`Aqili from Ubayy ibn Ka`b in a Marfu` report (i.e., attributed to the Prophet). Ibn Al-Mubarak said: I think that the Zanadiqah fabricated it.\nThe Hadith has several chains of narrations all of which are false and fabricated… and there is no dispute among the scholars that this Hadith of Ubayy ibn Ka`b is fabricated. A number of Quran commentators were deceived by it and mentioned it in their books of Tafsir such as Ath-Tha`labi, Al-Wahidi and Az-Zamakhshari. No wonder, because they were not versed in this area of knowledge. (End quote from Al-Fawa`id Al-Majmu`ah fi Al-Ahadith Al-Mawdu`ah, p. 264)\nThe fact that this Hadith is false was mentioned by Ibn `Adi in Al-Kamil (7/2588) and by As-Suyuti in Al-La`ali’ Al-Masnu`ah (1/227) and by Al-Dhahabi in Tartib Al-Mawdu`at, 60, and by others.\nNote: Many Hadiths were fabricated about the virtues of various Surahs of the Quran. Their fabricators` intention was to encourage people to read Quran and devote themselves to that, and they claimed that they were doing good thereby.\nBut their intentions were misguided because that is undoubtedly subject to the stern warning contained in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 10; Muslim, 4) It makes no difference whether the lie is intended for good or for evil.\nMu’ammil ibn Isma`il (d. 206 AH) investigated this Hadith until he found the person who admitted to fabricating it. Mu’ammil said: A Shaykh told me this Hadith and I said to him: Who narrated this to you? He said: A man in Al-Mada`in, who is still alive. So I traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said: A Shaykh in Wasit. So I traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said: A Shaykh in Basrah. So I traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said:\xa0 A Shaykh in `Abadan. So I traveled to go and see him, and he took me by the hand and led me into a house, where there were some Sufi people and a Shaykh with them, and he said: This is the Shaykh who narrated it to me. I said: O Shaykh, who narrated this to you? He said: No one narrated it to me; rather we saw that the people had turned away from the Qur`an, so we fabricated this Hadith for them, to turn their hearts back to the Quran.\nAnother example is the Hadith of `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) concerning the virtues of the Quran Surah by Surah. Its fabricator, Nuh ibn Abu Maryam, was asked about it and he said: I saw that the people had turned away from the Quran and were preoccupied with the fiqh of Abu Hanifah and the Maghazi of Muhammad ibn Is-haq, so I fabricated these Hadiths for the sake of Allah.\xa0(Al-Mawdu`at by Ibn Al-Jawzi, 1/394; Sharh Muqaddimah Ibn As-Salah by Al-`Iraqi, 111)\nWith regard to Surat Al-Mulk, we have already discussed its virtues in question no\xa026240.\nMay Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 6460, 82800, 45839, 222887, 90186, 2241, 71359.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46531/any-virtues-of-surat-al-muzzammil
249126,"I have been looking for work on the Internet for a very long time. In fact there are a lot of moneymaking websites, but most of them are prohibited because of what they involve of deceit and riba. So I decided to earn money through YouTube, then I realized that I have to connect my channel to Google AdSense, but the ads on AdSense may not all be permissible. So I decided to work with the company called freedom.tm, which belongs to YouTube Partners. What is the ruling on working with it; in other words, is the money that is collected from freedom.tm, which belongs to YouTube Partners, halal or haram?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is nothing wrong with receiving money in return for putting ads on video clips that belong to you, subject to certain conditions:\n\nThat the subscription to the company should be free.\nThat the financial return should be known.\nThat the ads should be permissible, and should not include any promotion of things that are prohibited. If they do contain anything that is prohibited, it is not permissible to accept them and publish them, because that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): {And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty} [Al-Ma’idah 5:2], and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him in that, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest, and whoever calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him in it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4831).\n\nBut if you cannot control these ads, and they contain prohibited things, it is not permissible for you to deal with this company.\nSecondly:\nIt is clear from what we have read about this company that it is possible to increase your earnings by inviting people to subscribe, which is what is called referrals. If the new members do not have to pay any subscription fee, then there is nothing wrong with you receiving commission for inviting them and their joining the company, on condition that you make sure that the people whom you choose to invite will not accept unlawful ads.\nFor more details, please see the answers to questions no. 101806 and 198784.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/249126/ruling-on-making-money-by-putting-ads-on-video-clips-with-the-freedomtm-company
44039,"If the deceased is poor, who should pay the expenses of shrouding him, washing him and burying him etc.?","['Praise be to Allah.The Deceased’s Wealth: Funeral Expenses Paid First\nIf the deceased has any money then the expenses of preparing him for burial should be paid from his own money. This takes precedence over paying off his debts and executing his will if he left a will, and it comes before the division of the estate.\nThe evidence for that is what is reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning a man who died in `Arafah: “Shroud him in his two garments.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1851 and Muslim, 1206)\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad Al-Ma`ad (2/240) concerning the rulings that are derived from this Hadith:\nThe shroud takes precedence over the rights of the heirs and payment of debts, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered that he be buried in his two garments, and he did not ask about his heirs or any debts that he owed. If it had been otherwise he would have asked.\nJust as clothing him when he is alive takes precedence over paying off his debts, the same applies after death. This is the view of the majority, and there is a differing opinion to which no attention need be paid. (End quote)\xa0(Al-Majmu`, 5/147; Al-Mughni, 3/457)\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bada’i` As-Sana’i` (2/330): He should be shrouded from his entire wealth, before paying off debts, executing his will or dividing the estate, because this is one of the basic needs of the deceased. So it is like spending on him when he is alive. (End quote)\nFuneral Expenses When the Deceased Has No Wealth\nIf the deceased does not have any wealth, then shrouding him or her is the duty of the one who is obliged to spend on him or her (such as the father, son or husband). If there is no such person, then it must be done by Bayt Al-Mal. If there is no Bayt Al-Mal then it must be done by the Muslims.\xa0(Al-Majmu`, 5/148-150 and Bada’i` Al-Sana’i`, 2/330)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (5/219):\nBayt Al-Mal of the Muslims is mentioned before the Muslims in general because the Bayt Al-Mal is for all Muslims, unlike the case if it is done by the Muslims, because the one who donates it will feel that he has done him a favour. (End quote)\nHe also said (5/217):\nBut if we assume that there is an organisation that is responsible for that, there is nothing wrong if we shroud him from that, unless he issued instructions to the contrary, such as saying, Shroud me from my own wealth, in which case it is not permissible to shroud him using the public shrouds, whether that is done by a government organisation or a private one. (End quote)\nHusband’s Obligation to Pay for Wife’s Funeral\nBecause the husband is obliged to spend on his wife when she is alive, shrouding her is obligatory for him.\nThis is the view of Abu Hanifah, Ash-Shafi`i and Malik (may Allah have mercy on them). Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It must be paid for from her wealth.\xa0(Al-Majmu`, 5/148-150 and Hashiyat Ibn `Abidin, 3/101)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (5/219), commenting on the view of the majority: This view is more correct if he is well off.\nShaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is a husband obliged to shroud his wife? He replied:\nThe correct view is that the husband is obliged to shroud his wife, whether she is well off or not. This is part of spending and kind treatment, and the people regard it as wrong if it is suggested that if the wife of a rich and well off man dies, he does not have to shroud her. (End quote from Al-Fatawa Al-Jami`ah lil-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 2/242\xa0)\nWife’s Responsibility Towards Husband’s Burial\nBut a wife is not obliged to shroud her husband, because she is not obliged to spend on him when he is alive.\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bada’i` Al-Sana’i` (2/330): The wife is not obliged to shroud her husband, according to consensus, just as she is not obliged to clothe him when he is alive.

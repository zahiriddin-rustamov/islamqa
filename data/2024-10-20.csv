235026,"Everything in Islam is perfect, because it is from Allah, may He be exalted, and there is no dispute about the justice of Allah. But I once heard a disbeliever talking about the issue of abiding forever in hell, which made me wonder about this issue. He said that abiding forever in hell is unjust, because how could they be punished for eternity for some wrongdoing that is limited in nature and is not eternal, namely disbelief in this world? The Muslims respond to such specious arguments by saying that they are the ones who chose disbelief for themselves. Then the disbelievers respond by saying: we did not choose anything at all; rather we found ourselves in this state, and we do not even know about anything called hell. How should we respond to their specious argument about this matter? In fact, it is a matter that I think about a great deal, although I believe with certainty that Allah does not wrong people at all. I hope that you can explain and clarify.","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nWe have previously responded to this specious argument on our website. It is the sophistry of those heretics who do not believe in the hereafter, and do not believe in the reckoning or the punishment at all, and they do not believe in the resurrection and the Day of Judgement, as Shaykh ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for the sophistry of those heretics who do not believe in the hereafter, which Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in his detailed answer, Allah, may He be exalted, responded to it in the Quran. It is He Who knows how that which does not exist would be if it did exist, and He knew from eternity that evil is deeply rooted in the nature of these evil people, to the extent that even if they were punished for a limited time equal to the time for which they disobeyed Allah, then returned to this world, they would go back to their evil, which would make further punishment inevitable, for they cannot do otherwise. Allah, may He be exalted, says in Surat al-An`am (interpretation of the meaning):\n{If you could but see when they are made to stand before the Fire and will say, “Oh, would that we could be returned [to life on earth] and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers.”\nBut what they concealed before has [now] appeared to them. And even if they were returned, they would return to that which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars}\xa0[al-An`am 6:27-28].\nSecondly:\nIt is well known that Allah, may He be exalted, has created man to worship Him, may He be glorified and exalted, and He has created everything for man. So it is not appropriate for man to be distracted by what was created for him from the purpose for which he was created. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{ And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me }\xa0[adh-Dhariyat 51:56].\nThe mission of man and the purpose for which he exists is to worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. So if a person allows himself to be distracted from that, he deserves punishment.\nAllah sent prophets and messengers to humanity to explain to them the path of guidance:\n{[We sent] messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against Allah after the messengers. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:165].\nHe told them on the lips of His Messengers that whoever deviates from His path and ascribes partners to his Lord, his punishment will be hell, to abide therein forever, and he will have no share in the paradise of the Lord of the Worlds:\n{Indeed, he who associates others with Allah – Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his abode will be the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:72].\nHe has told us that the doer of good and the doer of evil are not equal; rather this comes under the heading of thinking ill of Allah and His Wisdom:\n{Should We equate those who believe and do righteous deeds with those who spread mischief in the land? Or should We equate those who fear Allah with the wicked?}\xa0[Sad 38:28]\n{And not equal are the blind and the seeing, nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds and the evildoer. Little do you remember}\xa0[Ghafir 40:58].\nAnd He has told us that on the Day of Resurrection, He will single out for His mercy those who believed in Him and believed His Messengers:\n{[Allah] said, My punishment – I afflict with it whom I will, but My mercy encompasses all things. So I will decree it [especially] for those who fear Me and give zakah and those who believe in Our verses,\nThose who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them. So they who have believed in him, honored him, supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him – it is those who will be the successful}\xa0[al-A`raf 7:156-157].\nIn Sahih Muslim, 2752, it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent one part down among jinn, humans, animals and insects, because of which they show compassion and mercy to one another, and a wild animal shows compassion to its young. And Allah has kept back ninety-nine parts of mercy by which He will show mercy to His slaves on the Day of Resurrection.”\nAfter that, whoever disbelieves has disbelieved after having seen clear signs, and he has chosen for himself that fate which Allah has made inevitable for the disbelievers. Allah, may He be exalted, has shown him the two paths, so whoever wishes, let him believe, and whoever wishes, let him disbelieve, for he has chosen disbelief for himself with full awareness of his choice, and he knows where his deeds will take him. So what injustice can there be for such a person, who returns to his Lord having stubbornly disobeyed Him all his life? Even if he lived as long as Iblis, he would not give up his disbelief and stubbornness; rather he would persist in that until the end of time, just like the leader of the evildoers, the accursed Iblis.\nThirdly:\nAs for the specious argument which says that the disbelievers found themselves in this situation, it may be said regarding that:\nThe person who finds himself in a state of poverty would not accept this argument for himself – rather he would strive to acquire the blessings and bounty of this world so that he can change his situation.\nAnd the one who finds himself in a state of sickness would strive to seek treatment so that he can regain his health.\nThis is how the wise person should be: if he finds himself in a situation of misguidance, he must strive to take himself out of the darkness and into the light. He must seek out sources of guidance and the path to paradise, otherwise this is the argument of the disbelievers of all nations:\n{And when it is said to them: Come to the Revelation that Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger, they say: Sufficient for us is what we found our forefathers following. [Would they do that] even though their forefathers did not know anything and were not guided?}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:104].\nAnd Allah, may He exalted, says:\n{Or have We given them a book before this to which they are holding fast?\nIn fact they say: We found our forefathers following a certain path, and we are following in their footsteps.\nLikewise, We never sent any warner before you to a city but its affluent ones said: We found our forefathers following a certain path, and we are following in their footsteps.\n[The warner] said: Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your forefathers following? They said: Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.\nSo We exacted retribution upon them; so see what was the fate of those who disbelieved}\xa0[az-Zukhruf 43:21-25].\nIn that case, if the message of the Messenger reaches a person in a way that constitutes proof against him, then he has no excuse before Allah, and he has no argument after that. Rather what he must do is follow guidance, no matter what his religion was before that:\n{[We sent] messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against Allah after the messengers. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:165]\n{Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And never would We punish until We sent a messenger}\xa0[al-Isra’ 17:15].\nAs for one who grows up in a place where the call of the messenger did not reach him, or it reached him in a distorted form, and he did not see evidence to prove its soundness, and what he heard does not count as proof that would leave no excuse for him, then in this case it is up to Allah in the hereafter. Allah, He be exalted, has promised that He will not punish His slaves without the clear message having reached them.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNo one will enter Paradise except those who affirm the oneness of Allah, who are the people of “La ilaha illa Allah (there is no god worthy of worship except Allah).” This is the right of Allah over each of His slaves, as it was narrated in al-Bukhari and Muslim from Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him: “O Mu`adh, do you know what is the right of Allah over His slaves?” I said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: “His right over them is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him…”\nNo one will escape the punishment of Allah except those who devoted themselves to Allah and worshipped Him alone, and called upon Him with sincere devotion. As for those who did not associate anything with Him and did not worship Him, so they did not worship Him or worship anything other than Him, like Pharaoh and his ilk, they are worse than the polytheists. So it is obligatory to worship Allah alone, and this is obligatory for everyone, and it cannot be waived for anyone at all. This is what Islam means in general terms, and Allah will not accept any religion other than Islam.\nBut Allah will not punish anyone until He sends a messenger to him; however, even though He does not punish such a person, no one will enter Paradise except a believing Muslim; no polytheist and no person who is too arrogant to worship his Lord will enter it. So the one whom the call did not reach in this world will be tested in the hereafter, and no one will enter hell except one who followed the Shaytan. The one who has no sin on his record will not enter the fire, for Allah does not punish anyone with fire until after He sends a messenger to them. So for the one whom the call of the messenger who was sent to him did not reach, such as an infant, one who is insane and one who died during the interval between two prophets, he will be tested in the hereafter, as it says in the reports.

34464,"If the pilgrim performing Hajj or `Umrah wants to visit the Prophet’s Mosque, should he form the intention of visiting the mosque or of visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? And what is the etiquette of visiting the Prophet’s Mosque?","['Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nUnderstanding the Purpose of the Visiting the Prophet’s Mosque\n“If the pilgrim wants to visit the Prophet’s Mosque before or after Hajj, he should have the intention of visiting the mosque, not the grave, because travelling to a place for the purpose of worship does not include visiting graves, rather it includes only the three mosques: Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), Al-Masjid An-Nabawi (the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah) and Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), as it says in the Hadith which was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “No journey should be undertaken to any mosque except three: Al-Masjid Al-Haram, this mosque of mine and Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1189 and Muslim, 1397)\nEntering the Prophet’s Mosque: The Proper Procedure\nWhen the pilgrim reaches the Prophet’s Mosque, he should enter with his right foot first and say, “Bismillah was-salatu was-salam `ala Rasulillah. Allahumma ighfir li dhunubi waftah li abwab rahmatika. A`udhu Billah il-`adhim wa bi wajhihil-karim wa bi sultanihil-qadim min Ash-shaytan ir-rajim (In the name of Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. O Allah, forgive my sins and open to me the gates of Your mercy. I seek refuge in Allah the Almighty and in His noble Face and in His ancient Power, from the accursed devil).” Then he should pray as he likes.\nPraying in Ar-Rawdah: A Special Virtue\nIt is better for him to pray in Ar-Rawdah which is the area between the pulpit of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the room in which is his grave, because this area is one of the gardens (Riyad, sing. Rawdah) of Paradise.\nEtiquette of Visiting the Prophet’s Grave\nWhen he has prayed and wants to visit the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he should stand in front of it in a dignified manner and say, “As-salamu `alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu. Allahumma salli `ala Muhammad wa `ala ali Muhammad kama salayta `ala Ibrahim wa `ala ali Ibrahim, innaka hamidun majid; Allahumma barik `ala Muhammad wa `ala ali Muhammad\xa0 kama barakta `ala Ibrahim wa `ala ali Ibrahim, innaka hamidun majid. Ashhadu annaka Rasul-Allah haqqan wa annaka qad balaghta Ar-risalah wa adayta Al-amanah wa nasahta Al-ummah wa jahadta fillahi haqqa jihadihi. Fa jazaka Allahu `an ummatika afdal ma jaza nabiyyan `an ummatihi.\n(Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah, and His blessings. O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim, verily You are Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim, verily You are Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. I bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah, that you conveyed the message and fulfilled the trust, and advised the Ummah and strove truly for the sake of Allah. May Allah reward you on behalf of your Ummah better than any Prophet is rewarded on behalf of his nation).”\nVisiting the Companions’ Graves\nThen he should move a little to his right and send Salams upon Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and pray that Allah be pleased with him.\nThen he should move a little further to his right and send Salams upon `Umar ibn Al-Khattab and pray that Allah be pleased with him. If he makes Du`a for Abu Bakr and `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) in an appropriate manner, that is good.\nIt is not permissible for anyone to seek to draw closer to Allah by touching the room of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or by circumambulating it, or by facing it whilst making Du`a. Rather he should turn to face the Qiblah, because drawing closer to Allah can only be done by means of that which Allah and His Messenger have prescribed. Acts of worship are based on following not on innovation.\nEtiquette for Women Visiting the Prophet’s Mosque\nWomen should not visit the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or any other grave, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi and classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 843)\nRather a woman should pray and send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the place where she is, and that will reach the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) no matter where she is.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Send blessings upon me, for your blessings will reach me no matter where you are.” And he said, “Allah has angels who travel about throughout the land, conveying to me the Salams of my Ummah.” (Narrated by An-Nasa’i, 1282; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i, 1215)\nVisiting Other Holy Sites\nOnly men should visit Al-Baqi`, which is the graveyard of Madinah. They should say: “As-Salamu `alaykum ahl Ad-diyar min Al-mu’minin wal-muslimin, wa inna in sha Allah bikum lahiqun. Yarham Allah Al-mustaqdimina mina wa minkum wal-musta’khirin. Nas’al Allah lana wa lakum Al-`afiyah. Allahumma la tahrimna ajrahum wa la taftinna ba`dahum waghfir lana wa lahum.\n(Peace be upon you, O dwellers of these abodes, believers and Muslims. We will, when Allah wills, join you. May Allah have mercy on those who were first (to die) and those who were last. We ask Allah to grant salvation to us and you. O Allah, deprive us not of reward (similar to theirs) and lead us not astray after they are gone; forgive us and them).”\nIf the pilgrim then wants to go to Mount Uhud and remember what happened there to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions in that battle of Jihad, trials and martyrdom, and send Salams upon the martyrs there, such as Hamzah ibn `Abd Al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him), the paternal uncle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there is nothing wrong with that, because that is a kind of travelling through the land as enjoined (in Islam) [cf. An-Nahl 16:36].” (End quote from Al-Manhaj li Murid Al-`Umrah wal-Hajj)\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 36647, 34752, 115693, 21960.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34464/etiquette-of-visiting-the-prophets-mosque
33582,Suppose I am praying Sunnah and the iqamah is being announced. Should I perform the salutation and join Salatul Fard or should I continue?,"['Praise be to Allah.Understanding the Hadith on Praying Optional Prayer during Iqamah\nMuslim (710) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Iqamah for prayer is given, there is no prayer except the prescribed prayer.”\nThis Hadith indicates that once the Iqamah has been given for prayer, then no one should start to offer an optional prayer.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “When the Iqamah for prayer is given, do not be distracted from it by optional prayer, whether one fears missing the first Rak`ah or not. This is the view of Abu Hurayrah, Ibn `Umar, `Urwah, Ibn Sirin, Sa`id ibn Jubayr, Ash-Shafi`i, Is-haq and Abu Thawr.” (End quote from Al-Mughni, 1/272)\nScholarly Opinions on Ending Optional Prayer during Iqamah\nSome of the scholars also quoted this Hadith as evidence that the person who is offering an optional prayer when the Iqamah is given should cut short that prayer.\nAl-Hafidh Al-`Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “His words ‘there is no prayer’ may be interpreted as meaning that he should not start an optional prayer in that case; or it may be interpreted as meaning that he should not be distracted by an optional prayer, and if he had started it before the Iqamah then he should cut it short so that he can catch up with the opening Takbir [with the Imam], or that it is invalid in and of itself even if the worshipper does not cut it short. It may be understood as meaning both of these.”\nIt was narrated from Shaykh Abu Hamid, one of the Shafi`is, that it is better to stop the optional prayer if completing means that he is going to miss the opening Takbir with the imam. (The words of Al-`Iraqi were quoted by Ash-Shawkani in Nayl Al-Awtar, 3/91)\nThis was also stated in a Fatwa issued by the Standing Committee, when they were asked:\nIs it permissible to cut short an optional prayer and join the opening Takbir with the imam, or should one complete the optional prayer?\nThey replied:\nYes, if the Iqamah for an obligatory prayer is given, then you should cut short your optional prayer so that you can join the opening Takbir with the imam, because it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the Iqamah for prayer is given, then there is no prayer but the prescribed prayer.”\xa0(End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 7/312)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the correct view is that if the Iqamah for prayer is given whilst the person is still in the first Rak`ah of an optional prayer, then he should cut it short; if that happens when he is in the second Rak`ah then he should complete it quickly and not cut it short.\nHe said (may Allah have mercy on him):\nWhat we think concerning this matter is that if you are in the second Rak`ah, then you should complete it quickly, but if you are in the first Rak`ah, then you should cut it short. Our evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever catches up with one Rak`ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 580 and Muslim, 607).\nSo the person who has prayed a Rak`ah before the Iqamah for prayer is given has caught up with a Rak`ah that is free of any impediments, which here means the Iqamah for prayer, so he has caught up with the prayer by doing a Rak`ah before the prayer becomes disallowed, so he should complete it quickly… Then he said: This is the view that reconciles all the evidence. (End quote from Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 4/238)\nHow to Conclude Optional Prayer If Iqamah Begins\nIf he cuts short the optional prayer he should do so without saying the Taslim.\nThe Standing Committee was asked (7/312): If the Iqamah for prayer is given and there is a person who is doing two Rak`ahs of Sunnah prayer or “Greeting the Mosque”, should he cut short his prayer so that he can offer the obligatory prayer with the congregation? If the answer is yes, then should he say the Taslim when cutting short his prayer, or should he cut it short without the Taslim?\nThey replied:\nThe more correct of the two scholarly views is that he should cut short that prayer, and there is no need to say the Taslim when doing so. Then he should join the Imam.\nFor more details, please see the following answers:\nIs praying two Rak‘ahs between the Adhan and Iqamah recommended for women as well as for men?\nAt what point should one stand up when hearing the Iqamah?\nIs there a set time for the Iqamah (call immediately before the prayer)?\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33582/should-you-stop-sunnah-prayer-when-iqamah-is-announced
317072,Is renewing wudu one of the conditions of the prayer of repentance even if I am already in a state of purity?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nIslam encourages the one who repents to do wudu, pray two rak`ahs and seek forgiveness.\nIt was narrated that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was a man who, if I heard a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), Allah would cause me to benefit from it as much as He willed, but if one of his companions told me about it, I would ask him to confirm it with an oath, then if he swore an oath I would believe him.\nAbu Bakr told me – and Abu Bakr spoke the truth – saying: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no one who commits a sin, then purifies himself well, then stands up and prays two rak`ahs, then asks Allah for forgiveness, but Allah will forgive him.” Then he recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins – and who can forgive sins except Allah? – and [who] do not knowingly persist in what they have done}\n[Al `Imran 3:135].\nNarrated by Abu Dawud, 152; and by at-Tirmidhi, 406, who said: The hadith of `Ali is a sound hadith. Shaykh al-Albani classed its isnad as authentic in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 5/252.\nThat is aimed at achieving perfect repentance and removing the traces of sin, because each of these actions, according to Islamic teachings, is a means of erasing sin, and each of them has been enjoined in specific terms.\nRegarding wudu, it is narrated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When a Muslim – or a believer – does wudu and washes his face, every sin that he looked at with his eyes comes out from his face with the water – or with the last drop of the water. When he washes his hands, every sin that he committed with his hands comes out from his hands with the water – or with the last drop of the water. When he washes his feet, every sin to which he walked with his feet comes out from his feet with the water – or with the last drop of the water – until he emerges cleansed of sin.” Narrated by Muslim, 244.\nIt was narrated that `Uthman ibn `Affan said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does wudu and does wudu well, his sins come out of his body, even from beneath his nails.” Narrated by Muslim, 245.\nRegarding prayer, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds. That is a reminder for those who remember}\n[Hud 11:114].\nRegarding seeking forgiveness, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins – and who can forgive sins except Allah? – and [who] do not knowingly persist in what they have done.\nThose – their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of those who work [and strive]!}\n[Al `Imran 3:135-136].\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah indicate that the punishment of sin may be waived by approximately ten means, the first of which is repenting; there is consensus regarding that among the Muslims…\nThe second means is seeking forgiveness, as it was narrated in al-Bukhari and Muslim from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he said: “If a person commits a sin, then says: ‘O Lord, I have committed a sin; forgive me,’ Allah says: ‘My slave knows that he has a Lord Who forgives sins and brings people to account for them; I have forgiven My slave’…”\nIn Sahih Muslim it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “If you did not repent, Allah would do away with you and would bring people who would commit sin then ask for forgiveness, and He would forgive them.”\nEnd quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 7/487-488.\nGenerally speaking, if one does good deeds after bad deeds, there is the hope that they will be erased. It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to me: “Fear Allah wherever you are; follow a bad deed with a good deed, and it will erase it; and have a good attitude towards people.” Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 1987; he said: This is a good, authentic hadith.\nSecondly:\nIf a sinner has wudu at the time when he commits the sin, and nothing comes out of him that would invalidate his wudu, then in this case it is not stipulated that this sinner should repeat his wudu in order to pray two rak`ahs, but it is recommended for him to do that. Committing sin does not invalidate wudu.\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhen a person purifies himself, he remains in a state of purity unless there is evidence to indicate that his state of purity has been invalidated.\nAll of the scholars of the regions from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that slander, lying and backbiting do not invalidate a state of purity or make it obligatory to do wudu.\nThis is also the view of the scholars of Madinah and of Kufa, ahl ar-ra’y and others. And it is the view of ash-Shafa`i, Ahmad and Is-haq.\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he was asked: do stealing, treachery, lying, immoral actions and looking at that which is not permissible make it obligatory to do wudu? He said: No; there are two types of impurity, that which results from sins of the tongue [and does not require wudu] and that which results from bodily functions [which does require wudu]…\nIt was narrated from more than one of the earlier scholars that they used to enjoin wudu for one who uttered foul speech and offended the Muslims…\nBut I do not think that those who enjoined wudu enjoined it except by way of recommendation; that is clear from the wording of their statements.\nEnd quote from al-Awsat, 1/230-233.\nFor more information on things that invalidate wudu, please see the answer to question no. 14321.\nBased on that, if this person prayed without renewing his wudu, his prayer is valid.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/317072/is-it-necessary-to-renew-wudu-in-order-to-offer-the-prayer-of-repentance

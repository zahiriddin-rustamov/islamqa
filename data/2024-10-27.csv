118225,"In the [online] reading library, vol. 2, hadith section, in a commentary on Riyadh as-Salihin by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), no. 18, in the chapter on the prohibition on innovations and newly introduced matters, it was narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance leads to the fire.” Narrated by Muslim. And the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.” Narrated by Muslim. I hope that you can explain these two hadiths and how they are connected to one another.","['Praise be to Allah.These two hadiths are among the most important hadiths on the issue of innovation (bid`ah). They are the texts on which the scholars based their definition of innovation and defined its limits and guidelines. If we take into consideration all the narrations of the two hadiths along with other hadiths, we will be able to understand this issue more precisely.\nDr. Muhammad Husayn al-Jizani (may Allah preserve him) said:\nIn the Sunnah there are several hadiths which point to the correct understanding of the word bid`ah (innovation) from a religious point of view. These hadiths include:\n-1-\nThe hadith of al-`Irbad ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4067)\n-2-\nThe hadith of Jabir ibn `Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in his khutbah: “The truest of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of matters are those which are newly introduced, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance leads to the fire.” (This version was narrated by an-Nasa’i in his Sunan, 3/188)\nAs is clear from these two hadiths, innovation (bid`ah) is that which is newly introduced. In order to understand this idea, we should examine what is meant by newly introduced as mentioned in other hadiths. Regarding that there is\n-3-\nThe hadith of `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours anything that is not part of it, it will be rejected.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2697, and Muslim, 1718)\n-4-\nAccording to another report: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718)\nIf we reflect on these four hadiths, we will learn from them the definition of bid`ah and what it really is from the Islamic perspective.\nFrom the Islamic perspective, bid`ah is defined by three unique characteristics, and a thing cannot be regarded as bid`ah according to the teachings of Islam unless it has the three characteristics, which are:\n\nIt is newly introduced.\nThis newly introduced thing is attributed to the religion of Islam.\nThis newly introduced thing has no basis in the religious texts, whether in a specific sense or in general terms.\n\nThere follow further examples of these three characteristics:\n1.. Being newly introduced\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him, “Whoever introduces…” and “Every newly introduced matter is an innovation.”\nWhat these hadiths refer to is introducing something that is newly invented and unprecedented. This includes every newly introduced thing, whether it is blameworthy or praiseworthy, in the field of religion or otherwise.\nBecause the introduction of new things may happen in worldly matters or in religious matters, there should be two other characteristics of the newly introduced thing:\n2.. Being attributed to the religion of Islam\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “into this matter of ours.” What is meant by this “matter” is his religion and teachings.\nWhat is meant by innovation (bid`ah) is that the newly introduced thing is attributed to Islam in one way or another. This is something that may be achieved in one of three ways:\n\nSeeking to draw close to Allah by means of something that He did not prescribe;\ndrifting away from the teachings of Islam;\n\n\nand a third way may be added, which is the means that could lead to innovation.\n\nBy defining innovation in this manner, we exclude new inventions and newly introduced matters pertaining to worldly life, that have nothing to do with religion. We also exclude sins and evil practices that have been introduced, that were not known before. Such things cannot be described as bid`ah, unless they are done by way of seeking to draw close to Allah, or are done in such a way that they give the impression that they are part of religion.\n3.. Not having any basis in the religious texts, whether in a specific sense or general terms\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “that is not part of it” and “that is not in accordance with this matter of ours.”\nThis characteristic excludes newly introduced matters having to do with religion for which there is a basis in the religious texts, either in a general or specific sense.\nThings that were introduced in religion for which there is a basis in the religious texts in general terms include that which is done on the basis of the general interest, such as when the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) collected the Quran.\nA matter that was introduced in this religion and was based on the religious texts in a specific sense was the introduction of praying Tarawih in congregation at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), which was based on a specific religious text. Another example is reviving Islamic teachings that have been abandoned; examples of that may vary greatly from one time and place to another. Another example is remembering Allah in times and places where people are heedless of His remembrance.\nWith regard to the linguistic meaning of the word ihdath (introducing new things), it is valid to describe things that are based on the evidence of religious texts as newly introduced, because these things were originally Islamic practices, so doing them again after they have been abandoned or become unknown is introducing them as new in a relative sense.\nIt is important to note that any newly introduced thing for which there is evidence in the religious texts to prove that it is sound cannot – from an Islamic point of view – be called newly introduced and it is not an innovation (bid`ah), because according to Islamic teachings, things can only be called newly introduced innovations when there is no evidence for them in the religious texts.\nThere follows confirmation of these three guidelines from the words of the scholars:\nIbn Rajab said: If someone introduces something new and attributes it to Islam when there is no basis for it in the religious texts, it is misguidance and has nothing to do with Islam. (Jami` al-`Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/128)\nHe also said: What is meant by innovation is that which is introduced for which there is no basis in the religious text to support it. As for that for which there is a religious text to support it, it is not regarded as innovation in a religious sense, even if it is regarded as innovation in a linguistic sense. (Jami` al-`Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/127)\nIbn Hajar said: What is meant by the words “Every innovation is misguidance” is what is newly introduced with no evidence from the religious texts in either a specific or general sense. (Fat-h al-Bari, 13/254)\nHe also said: This hadith – meaning the hadith “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours anything that is not part of it, it will be rejected” – is regarded as one of the fundamentals and basic principles of Islam. If someone invents anything in religion for which there is no reference in any of the basic teachings of Islam, no attention should be paid to it. (Fat-h al-Bari, 5/302).\nFrom the above, we may define what is meant by innovation (bid`ah) in Islamic teachings: it is that to which all the three guidelines mentioned above apply. These guidelines may be summed up by saying:\nInnovation is that which is newly introduced into the religion of Allah, for which there is no religious text which may support it in either general or specific terms.\nMore concisely: it is that which is newly introduced into the religion without any evidence.

85622,What is meant by lowering the gaze?,"['Praise be to Allah.Linguistic meaning of lowering the gaze\nLowering the gaze (Ghadd Al-basar) means restraining the gaze and not allowing it to wander or dwell upon anything.\nIbn Faris said in Mu`jam Maqayis Al-Lughah (4/307):\xa0“Ghayn and dad indicate restraining, as in the phrase Ghadd Al-basar (lowering the gaze)…”\nIbn Al-Manzur said in Lisan Al-`Arab (7/196):\xa0“Lowering the gaze (Ghadd Al-basr) means restraining it.”\nThe Islamic meaning of lowering the gaze\nIn Islamic terminology lowering the gaze refers to a number of things:\n\nRefraining from looking at people’s `Awrahs, which includes the beauty of a non-mahram woman.\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (15/414):\n“Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has enjoined us in His Book to lower the gaze, which is of two types: refraining from looking at `Awrahs and refraining from looking at the site of desire.\nThe former refers to a man refraining from looking at the `Awrah of another person.\nThe second refers to looking at uncovered parts of a non-mahram woman. This is more serious than the former, just as alcohol is more serious than dead meat and blood and pork, and the hadd punishment should be carried out on the one who drinks it, because these prohibited things are not as desirable as alcohol may be.”\n\nRefraining from looking into people’s houses and things that are behind closed doors.\n\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) says in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (15/379):\nJust as lowering the gaze includes not looking at the `Awrahs of other people and other prohibited things, it also includes refraining from looking into people’s houses. A man’s house conceals his body just as his garments conceal him. Allah has mentioned lowering the gaze and guarding one’s private parts after the verse about asking for permission to enter, because the house covers a person just as the clothes on his body do. End quote.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Madarij As-Salikin (1/117):\n“Prohibited kinds of looking include looking at `Awrahs, which is of two types: the `Awrah behind a garment and the `Awrah behind doors.” (End quote)\n\nRefraining from looking at what people have of wealth, wives, children, worldly goods and so on.\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Look not with your eyes ambitiously at what We have bestowed on certain classes of them (the disbelievers), nor grieve over them. And lower your wings for the believers (be courteous to the fellow-believers).” [Al-Hijr 15:88]\nIbn Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (434):\n“This means, do not admire them in such a way that you will distracted with desire for the worldly pleasures enjoyed by those who live in luxury and by which the ignorant are deceived. You should be content with that which Allah has given you of the seven oft-repeated verses and the Holy Quran (cf. Al-Hijr 15:87). (End quote)\nHe also said (p. 516):\n“This means,\xa0 do not be impressed and do not look repeatedly admiring worldly pleasures and those who are enjoying them, such as delicious food and drink, fine clothing, beautiful houses and adorned women, for all of that is the adornment of this world in which those who are deceived rejoice. And those who do wrong enjoy it by ignoring the Hereafter. But it will all soon end and cease to be, and those who love it will die, then they will regret when regret will be to no avail, and they will realize the state they are in when the Resurrection begins. Allah has made it a test and a trial, so that it may be known who will be deceived by it and who will be better in deeds. (End quote)\nBenefits of lowering the gaze\nThe scholars have mentioned many benefits of lowering the gaze, including the following:\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jawab Al-Kafi (125):\n“There are a number of benefits in lowering the gaze:\n\nIt is obedience to the command of Allah, which brings happiness to man in this world and in the next. There is nothing more beneficial to a person in this world and in the next than obeying the commands of his Lord, may He be Blessed and Exalted, and those who are happy in this world and the next can only attain that happiness by obeying His commands, and those who are doomed in this world and in the next are only doomed because they ignore His commands.\nIt prevents the poisoned arrows (of the devil), which may lead to his doom, from reaching his heart.\nIt creates a heart that is devoted to and focused on Allah. Letting the gaze wander distracts the heart and keeps it far from Allah. There is nothing more harmful to a person than letting his gaze wander, as it creates alienation between a person and his Lord.\nIt strengthens the heart and brings it peace, just as letting the gaze wander weakens it and makes it sad.\nIt brings light to the heart, just as letting the gaze wander brings darkness to it. Hence Allah mentioned the verse of light immediately after the command to lower the gaze, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts…} [An-Nur 24:30]\nThen straight after that He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp.} [An-Nur 24:35]\ni.e., the likeness of His light in the heart of His believing slave who obeys His commands and heeds His prohibitions. If the heart is enlightened blessings will come to it from all sides, but if it is darkened, calamity and evil will come to it from all places. Whatever exists of innovation, misguidance, following whims and desires, avoiding true guidance and turning away from the means of happiness and focusing on the means that lead to doom, that will be recognizable by means of the light that is in the heart. If that light is lost then one will left like a blind man stumbling in the darkness.\n\nIt generates true insight which can distinguish between truth and falsehood, sincerity and lies. Allah rewards His slave for his good deeds with something similar and if he gives up something for the sake of Allah, He will compensate him with something better than it. So if he lowers his gaze and refrains from looking at things that Allah has forbidden, Allah will compensate him with enlightenment; he will compensate him for restraining his gaze for the sake of Allah, and will open to him the doors of knowledge, faith and true insight which he only attained by means of the light in his heart. The opposite of that is the blindness which Allah attributed to the homosexuals, which is the opposite of insight. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{Verily, by your life (O Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.} [Al-Hijr 15:72]\n\nIt creates a heart that is steadfast, brave and strong. Allah will give him both insight and power and strength, as it says in the report: “The one who goes against his whims and desires, the devil flees from his shadow.”\n\nOn the other hand, the one who follows his whims and desires will feel a sense of humiliation, indignity, worthlessness and insignificance, which is the punishment which Allah has decreed for those who disobey Him as Al-Hasan said: “Even if they ride the finest of mounts, the effect of sin will never depart from them. Allah insists that the one who disobeys Him will be humiliated.”\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has connected strength to obedience to Him, and humiliation to disobedience to Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{But honour, power and glory belong to Allah, and to His Messenger (Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and to the believers.} [Al-Munafiqun 63:8]\n{So do not become weak (against your enemy), nor be sad, and you will be superior (in victory) if you are indeed (true) believers.} [Al `Imran 3:139]\nFaith is both words and deeds, inward and outward. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whosoever desires honour, power and glory then to Allah belongs all honour, power and glory [and one can get honour, power and glory only by obeying and worshipping Allah (Alone)]. To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allah unless and until they are followed by good deeds)} [Fatir 35:10]\ni.e., whoever desires power, let him seek it by means of obedience to Allah and remembrance of Him, by speaking good words and doing good deeds. In Du’a’ Al-Qunut it says: “he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, nor is he honoured who You take as an enemy”. Whoever obeys Allah is His friend in as much as he obeys Him, and he will have support and honour from Him commensurate with his obedience towards Him. Whoever disobeys Him is His enemy in as much as he disobeys Him, and he will have humiliation from Him commensurate with his disobedience towards Him.\n\nIt blocks the devil from a means of entering his heart, for he may enter with looking, and penetrate the heart faster than the wind blowing through an empty space, and he may present to him the image that he looked at and make it attractive, like an idol to which his heart becomes devoted, then he encourages him and gives him hopes, and fans the flames of desire in his heart, adding the fuel of sin which could not have reached his heart without looking at that image. So his heart becomes inflamed and surrounded with fire on all sides, resulting in infatuation and frustration, and he is in the midst of it like a lamb in the oven. Hence the punishment for those whose desires were fuelled by prohibited looking is that in Al-Barzakh they are placed in an oven of fire.\nIt distracts one from thinking of what is in one’s best interests, so his affairs become neglected and he follows his whims and desires and neglects to remember his Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and who follows his own lusts, and whose affair (deeds) has been lost.} [Al-Kahf 18:28]\n\nBetween the eyes and the heart there is a connection which means that the one is affected by the other, and if one of them becomes good, the other will also become good, and if one becomes corrupt the other will become corrupt. If the heart becomes corrupt the gaze will become corrupt, and if the gaze becomes corrupt the heart will become corrupt, and similarly if one is sound the other will also be sound.” (End quote)\n\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 113996, 126925, 160554, 49024, and 21784.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/85622/meaning-of-lowering-the-gaze

2) If it is authentic, does this mean that trimming your mustache is fard?
3) There is a hadith that says “Do the opposite of what the polytheists do ; let the beard grow long and clip the moustache.” From this hadith, scholars said that keeping the beard is fard, so why is cutting the mustache a sunnah when it is mentioned in the same hadith? Why did scholars say that part of the hadith is an obligation whereas the other part is a sunnah, arent both of them commands from the prophet?","['Praise be to Allah.Trimming the moustache is one of the proven sunnahs of the fitrah (sound human inclination).\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe reports that are soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicate that trimming the moustache and nails is part of the fitrah (sound human inclination), and that he enjoined trimming the moustache and letting the beard grow.\nEnd quote from al-Awsat, 1/238.\nBut the scholars differed to the degree to which it is prescribed: is it a recommended sunnah or is it an obligatory action?\nSome of the scholars were of the view that it is obligatory, and this is what is implied by the apparent meaning of the two hadiths referred to.\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nand he should trim his moustache… Ibn Hazm narrated that there was consensus that trimming the moustache and letting the beard growth is obligatory.\nOur companions and others said that it is recommended, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to do that, as he said: “And be different from the polytheists.” (al-Bukhari and Muslim). Muslim narrated that he said: “Be different from the Zoroastrians.” It was narrated from Zayd ibn Arqam in a marfu‘ report: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us.” Narrated by Ahmad, an-Nasa’i and at-Tirmidhi and classed as authentic by the latter. This version, according to our companions, indicates that it is prohibited.\nEnd quote from al-Furu‘, 1/151-152.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for trimming the moustache, the evidence indicates that it is obligatory to trim it when it becomes long, and this is the correct view, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined that, and because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us.”\nEnd quote from Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 257.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Ali Adam al-Ethiopi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted this hadith, the hadith “and trim the moustache,” and similar evidence for it being obligatory to trim the moustache, as noted in al-Fat-h. In al-Manhal he added: Some of the Hanafis and the majority of scholars are of the view that it is recommended. Then he said: What is more likely to be correct is the first view. And Allah knows best.\nEnd quote from Dhakhirat al-‘Uqba, 1/380.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that it is sunnah, and they think that the two hadiths referred to do not say that it is obligatory to remove something from the moustache by cutting or shaving.\nWith regard to the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam, according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us,” it was narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 2761, and others. A number of scholars stated that it is authentic, including at-Tirmidhi who said, after narrating the hadith: This is an authentic, sound hadith.\nThey thought that what was meant by the phrase “is not one of us” is that he is not following our guidance and path.\nAl-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe hadith of a man from Banu Ghifar, “Whoever does not shave his pubic hair, clip his nails and trim his moustache is not one of us,” indicates that doing these things is obligatory.\nThe response to that is twofold:\nFirstly, this hadith is not proven, because its isnad includes Ibn Luhay`ah, and the scholarly reservations about him are well known. Rather only the part about trimming the moustache is proven, as was narrated and classed authentic by at-Tirmidhi, and was also narrated by an-Nasa’i, from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us.”\nSecondly, what is meant – assuming that it is soundly narrated – is that he is not following our path, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who does not recite the Qur’an in a melodious voice.” This is definitely the intended meaning, and Allah knows best.\nEnd quote from Tarh at-Tathrib, 2/82.\nRegarding the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Be different from the polytheists: let your beard grow and trim your moustaches” (al-Bukhari, 5829; Muslim, 259),\nthey thought that the view that it is obligatory to let the beard grow and that it is prohibited to shave it does not necessarily imply that it is obligatory to cut the moustache and is prohibited to leave it, because the fact that these things are mentioned together in this command does not mean that they are equal in the degree of the command, as is the view of the majority of scholars of usul al-fiqh.\nAz-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the two phrases being mentioned together, it does not mean that they are equal to other rulings that are not mentioned, in contrast to the view of Abu Yusuf and al-Muzani.\nCommentary: the fact that the two things are mentioned together \xa0with regard to a ruling does not mean that they are equal to other rulings that are not mentioned. Hence what is obligatory may be mentioned after something that is recommended, as in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Eat of [each of] its fruit when it yields and give its due [zakah] on the day of its harvest}\n[al-An`am 6:141].\nAbu Yusuf, among the Hanafis, and al-Muzani among us, said: This means that they are equal, because the fact that one is mentioned after the other means that the ruling applies equally to both of them.\nEnd quote from Tashnif al-Masami`, 2/757.\nThe commentator Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe view that when two things are mentioned together they are subject to the same ruling is regarded as weak by most of the scholars of usul…\nBut some of the scholars regarded quoting that as evidence as being sound.\nEnd quote from Adwa’ al-Bayan, 3/266.\nBased on that, each phrase has its own ruling, depending on the context and other evidence.\nRegarding the phrase “trim your moustaches”, it was said that what is meant is to keep the moustache neat and clean, and it is more appropriate for that to be recommended, as is the case with using the siwak and putting on perfume before going to Jumu`ah prayer, and the like.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi went too far when he said: In my view, the five characteristics mentioned in this hadith are all obligatory, and if a person neglects one of them, he will no longer look like a human, let alone look like a Muslim.\nHe said something similar in Sharh al-Muwatta’, and Abu Shamah commented on it by noting that the things that are required to make one look neat and clean do not need a command from the Lawgiver, because it is sufficient that one has a natural inclination to do them, so merely recommending them is enough.\nEnd quote from Fat-h al-Bari, 10/339-340.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/376756/is-trimming-the-moustache-sunnah-or-obligatory

He said: If one adds to that the words narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), “Allahumma inna nasta‘inuka… (O Allah, we seek Your help)…”, there is nothing wrong with that. (End quote the comments of Ibn Muflih on Al-Muharrar, 1/89)\nIndeed, some of the scholars spoke sternly about the issue of adding to the ‘Du`as narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him, to the extent that Al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd As-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said – as it says in his Fatawa, 87 –: “It is not appropriate to add anything to or subtract anything from what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in Qunut.” (End quote from ‘Udu ila Khayr Al-Huda, p. 45)\nRuling of adding to the wording of Qunut\nThere is nothing wrong with adding to the wording narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Qunut words that may be appropriate to the situation, because this is the issue of Du`a (supplication), and the issue of du a’ is broad in scope, and adding to it is something that is allowed in Islam. Concerning the Du`a narrated from ‘Umar, it says: … and he would pray for whatever he could of good for the Muslims, then he would pray for forgiveness for the believers.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (3/477-478):\n“Shaykh Abu ‘Amr ibn As-Salah said: The view of those who say that one should limit Du`a in Qunut to that which is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is odd and is not acceptable; it is contrary to the opinion of the majority of our companions and in fact is contrary to the opinion of the majority of scholars. Al-Qadi ‘Iyad narrated that the scholars unanimously agreed that there is no specific Du`a for Qunut…\xa0\xa0 The author of Al-Hawi said: It may be done reciting the Du`a narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or by saying other Du`as. (End quote)\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (34/63):\xa0“He may add whatever he wants of Du`as that are permissible to say during prayer.” (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (4/52):\n“If he adds to that, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is the matter of Du`a (supplication).” (End quote)\nDo not add to the wordings of Qunut as regular practice\nIt is important to note that although adding (phrases not narrated in the Sunnah) to a Du`a narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is permissible according to the majority of scholars, it is not permissible to take that as a regular practice, thus neglecting the Sunnah and missing out on the blessing (barakah) of following the Sunnah as a result of that. Indeed, one should not always combine the two and regard them as being the same in status. Rather the worshipper should do that sometimes and not do it sometimes, according to the situation.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Undoubtedly dhikr and Du`as are among the best kinds of worship. Acts of worship are based on confirmed religious texts and adhering to the Sunnah, not on whims and desires and innovation. The Du`as and dhikrs narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are the best that anyone can find of dhikr and Du`a’, and the one who limits himself to them will be safe and sound. The beneficial results that they bring cannot be put into words or fully comprehended by man. Any other Dhikrs may be haram or they may be disliked. They may involve shirk which most people may not realise and which would take too long to explain in detail.\nNo one has the right to prescribe for people any kind of dhikr or Du`a that is not narrated in the Sunnah and make it an act of worship that people should perform regularly as they perform the five daily prayers regularly. Rather this is a kind of innovation in religion for which Allah has not given permission… As for adopting a Wird that is not prescribed in sharee’ah and dhikr that is not prescribed in sharee‘ah, this is something that is forbidden. Moreover the Du`as and Adhkar that are prescribed in sharee‘ah are the best and lead to achieving all aims and goals; no one turns away from them and adopts innovated and invented Adhkar except one who is ignorant, negligent or a wrong doer.” (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/510- 511)\nHow long should Qunut be?\nHow long should Qunut be? Is it prescribed to make it lengthy or not?\nIf we study the Hadith of Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali quoted above, we will find that the Du`a that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him is a brief and concise Du`a that only takes a few minutes. This indicates that what is appropriate in Du`a Al-Qunut is to make it brief and to stick to concise phrases.\nIt says in Mughni Al-Muhtaj, 1/369:\n“It says in Al-Majmu`, narrating from Al-Baghawi: It is disliked to make Qunut lengthy, like the first tashahhud. Al-Qadi Husayn said: If he makes Qunut longer than is usual, that is makruh.” (End quote)\nIn fact, an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) indicated that combining the Du`a of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Du`a of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) in Qunut comes under the heading of making it lengthy, and one should pay attention to the people’s circumstances and find out whether they approve of that.\nHe said: “Our companions said: It is recommended to combine the Qunut of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and that which is mentioned in the Hadith quoted above. If they are combined, then the more correct way is to recite the Qunut of ‘Umar second. And if he wants to keep it short, he should limit it to what is narrated in the Hadith. Rather it is recommended to combine the two if he is praying on his own or if he is an imam of people who approve of making it lengthy. And Allah knows best.” (Al-Majmu`, 3/478)\nIf combining the two Du`as mentioned, even though they are brief, is regarded as a kind of making it lengthy, then how about what is mentioned in your question of making it last for twenty minutes or thereabouts? What about those who offer Du`a for double that time or more, which many imams do who do not care about anything except giving a performance in front of people, Allah forbid? People have seen strange things of that nature nowadays.\nThe best approach in all of that – and Allah knows best – is to be moderate, for the best of affairs are those that are moderate; and Islam forbids making things difficult for people, especially if there is a custom of doing that every night.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question in Fatawa ‘Ulama’ Al-BaladAl-Haram (152):\nIn Ramadan, some of the imams in the mosques make the Du`a long, and some make it short. Which is the correct way?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\n“The correct way is not to exaggerate or to fall short. Making it so long that it causes hardship for the people is forbidden. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) heard that Mu‘adh ibn Jabal was making the prayer very lengthy when he led his people in prayer, he got angry in exhortation in an unprecedented manner, and he said to Mu‘adh ibn Jabal: “O Mu‘adh, do you want to put people off their religion?” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6106 and Muslim, 465)\nSo what should be done is adhering to the words narrated (in Hadith) or one may add more to that.\nUndoubtedly making it very lengthy causes hardship to people and exhausts them, especially the weak ones among them. Among the people are those who have work ahead of them but they do not like to leave before the imam, although it is difficult for them to stay with the imam. So my advice to my brother imams is to adopt a moderate approach. By the same token, they should refrain from offering Du`a on occasion, so that the common folk do not think that Du`a is obligatory.” (End quote)\nReciting Du`a Al-Qunut in a manner like reciting Quran\nWith regard to what you asked about reciting Du`a Al-Qunut (in a manner like reciting Qur’an) and beautifying the voice in it, if he exaggerates about that and is preoccupied with it and makes it his main concern, and he uses it as a means of attracting people’s attention to him, or he crosses the boundary between Du`a and exhortation or speaks as people ordinarily do, as in the case of the person referred to in your question, and as is done by many imams who toy with the people’s worship and emotions – if the situation is as described, then it is objectionable and is disapproved by everyone who knows the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and is rejected by everyone who has a sound nature.\nAl-Kamal ibn Al-Humam Al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when discussing the Mu’adhdhins who used to repeat the Takbir behind the Imam – in his time –\n“With regard to what you are accustomed to in this city, it is not unlikely that it is wrong, because it usually involves elongating the first syllable in the words “Allah” and “Akbar”, or the second syllable in the word “Akbar”, and that is wrong. Even if it does not involve that, they still raise their voices too much, more than is needed to convey the words, and they focus too much on their performance of tunes to show their proficiency in doing so, which has nothing to do with carrying out the act of worship properly.\nIt is obvious that the purpose behind this is to impress the people. It is as if he is saying: Look at my beautiful voice and how I come up with nice tunes, and that is wrong. I do not think that this would come from one who really understands the meaning of prayer and worship!\nIf this is what he said concerning the Mu’adhdhins, then what about the imams who do that in the prayer itself?! It is no wonder that he commented further and said:\nSimilarly, I think that coming up with nice tunes in Du`a, as some reciters do in our times, is not done by one who understands the real meaning of Du`a and asking of Allah. That is no more than a kind of playing about. If you saw someone making a request of a king and he put on this kind of performance, with his voice rising and falling as if singing, he would be accused of mockery and fooling about, because the appropriate way to ask is with beseeching and humility, not singing!” (End quote from Fat-h Al-Qadir by Kamal ibn Al-Humam, 2/225-226)\nWith regard to paying attention to making the voice beautiful, without exaggerating or pronouncing the letters differently from the correct Arabic pronunciation, it seems that this does not come under the heading of blameworthy singing referred to above.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about this and he replied in detail.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question, as it says in Fatawa Al-Balad Al-Haram (153):\nSome imams of mosques try to soften people’s hearts and move them by changing the tone of voice sometimes during taraweeh prayer and in Du`a Al-Qunut, and I heard that some scholars disapprove of that. What is your opinion of that?\nHis reply was:\n“What I think is that if this is done within Shar`i limits, without exaggerating, then there is nothing wrong with it. Hence Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): If I had known that you were listening to my recitation, I would have beautified it for you.” If someone has a beautiful voice or recites in a way that softens people’s hearts, I do not think there is anything wrong with that. But exaggerating with regard to that so that he does this with every single word of the Qur’an, as mentioned in the question – I think that this is excessive and should not be done. And Allah knows best.” (End quote)\nReference: See [in Arabic] the essays Du`a Al-Qunut by Shaykh Bakr ibn ‘Abdullah Abu Zayd; `Udu ila Khayr Al-Huda by Shaykh Muhammad Isma`il Al-Muqaddim.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81083/how-long-should-qunut-be

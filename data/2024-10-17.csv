215231,I read that the miracle of Nuh was the Flood. How can that be so when the Flood happened after the people disbelieved and rejected his message? What is known is that miracles were given to a prophet so that the people would believe him. The same may be asked with regard to Shu`ayb and Hud (peace be upon them). What was the miracle for each of these three messengers?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no prophet to whom Allah, may He be exalted, did not grant a clear sign to prove the truthfulness of the message that he brought, in order to establish proof against everyone who opposed him.\nAl-Bukhari, 4981, and Muslim, 152, narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is not a single Prophet who was not given signs so that the people would believe in him because of them. but what I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, and I hope that I will be the one with the most followers on the Day of Resurrection.”\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “There is not a single Prophet who was not given…” indicate that every prophet must have had a miracle that would lead anyone who witnessed it to believe that he was a true prophet; he would not be harmed by those who stubbornly refused to believe. What is meant is that every prophet was given one or more signs, so that the people who saw those signs would believe in him because of them. What is meant by signs is miracles; every prophet was given a miracle that was unique to him, and no one else was given the same miracle, with which to challenge his people. The miracle of each prophet was appropriate to the situation of his people. (End quote from Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar, 9/6).\nSecondly:\nIt is not essential for the Quran and Sunnah to mention the miracle of every prophet, because these miracles were not performed for us. No action is expected of us if we learn about it, and we are not required to believe in the true prophets because of their miracles, because those miracles happened in the past and the time for them is over. Rather we believe in the earlier prophets because of the true texts of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which speak of them.\nWhat we must do is know that Allah’s Prophet Nuh, Allah’s Prophet Hud and other Prophets of Allah were sent to their peoples, and they brought proof and clear evidence that was sufficient for them to accept their message and believe in them. We may know about some of their signs and miracles, or we may not know anything about them, just as we know the names and stories of some of the prophets which are mentioned in sound texts, or we may not know the names and stories of some of the prophets of Allah which are not mentioned in the sound religious texts.\nAz-Zajjaaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the words {There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. So give full measure and weight} [al-A`raf 7:85], some of the grammarians said that Shu`ayb had no sign except prophethood, but this is a serious mistake.\nHe said: {There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. So give full measure and weight} [al-A`raf 7:85]. The conjunction fa [translated here as so] indicates what is expected of you after the sign has come to you. How could he say, There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord when he has no sign except prophethood? If there was another sign along with prophethood, he would have brought it to them.\nThe suggestion that he had no sign is mistaken. If someone had claimed to be a prophet without any sign, that would not be accepted from him. But with regard to Shu`ayb, his sign was clear, as he said. But Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has mentioned some of the signs of the prophets in the Quran, and has not mentioned the signs of others. In the case of those whose signs were not mentioned, it cannot be said that they had no signs. (End quote from Ma`ani al-Quran, 2/353-354)\nSee also: Tafsir Ibn `Atiyyah, 2/426.\nThirdly:\nThe miracle of Allah’s Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) was the building of the ark on dry land, which was then able to sail on the waves which were like mountains, after he had warned his people of the Flood.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning a karamah that was bestowed on Abu Muslim al-Khawlani (may Allah have mercy on him):\nThis is akin to the miracle of Nuh (peace be upon him), when he sailed on the water in the ark which Allah, may He be exalted, had commanded him to build. (End quote from al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, 9/317)\nIt is not valid to object to that by saying, as the questioner did, that the Flood occurred after the people disbelieved and rejected the message, and the miracle was given to the prophet so that the people would believe him, because it may be said in response to this that Nuh (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had warned his people, alerted them and threatened them. Then when there came to them that which they had been warned about, they persisted in their arrogance and did not believe. If they had believed at that point, their faith would have been valid. Do you not see that Nuh (peace be upon him) urged his son to believe and said to him: {O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers} [Hud 11:42]? If his son had come aboard with them, he would have been one of the believers and not one of the disbelievers, and the same would have applied to others. So the miracle happened at the right time, and did not happen after it was too late.\nMoreover, it was one of the greatest of signs and proofs that Allah gave him, for it was clear evidence and sound proof for them, as Allah says:\n{He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I am relying on clear evidence from my Lord while He has bestowed on mercy from Himself but it has been been obscured from your sight, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?\nAnd O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from Allah. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.\nAnd O my people, who would protect me from Allah if I drove them away? Will you not then pay heed?”\nAnd I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of Allah or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those those who are contemptible in your eyes that Allah will never grant them any good. Allah knows best what is in their hearts. Indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers.”\nThey said, “O Noah, you have argued with us for too long. So bring us that with which you are threatening us, if you should be of the truthful”}\xa0[Hud 11:28-32].\nThe story of the proofs and arguments he presented to them is repeated in more than one surah of the Holy Quran.\nHaving said that, there is nothing to rule out the idea that he could have brought them a clear sign, but we have not been told about it or its nature, as noted above.\nSee also the answer to question no. 10470.\nSomething similar may be said about Allah’s Prophet Hud and Allah’s Prophet Shu`ayb (peace be upon them both). Either each of them had a miracle that we do not know about, and Allah has not told us about it, as noted above in the quotation from az-Zajjaj, or his miracle was the argument that he presented to his people and his prevailing over them with his wisdom and eloquent speech.\nIbn Abi’l-`Izz al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the most subtle of these signs given to the messengers is the sign of Hud, when his people said to him: {O Hud, you have not brought us clear evidence} [Hud 11:53], even though his proof was among the clearest of proof to anyone whom Allah enabled to reflect upon it. Hud pointed that out when he said:\n{I call Allah to witness, and you too are my witnesses, that I disavow all those whom you ascribe as partners\nto Allah. So scheme against me, all of you, and give me no respite.\nI put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature but He holds it [in His control] by its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on a straight path }\xa0[Hud 11:54-56].\nThis is one of the greatest signs: that one man addressed a great nation with these words, without any fear or panic or losing his nerve; rather he was confident and certain in what he said. Thus he called Allah, first and foremost, to witness that he disavowed their religion and the path they were following, like one who was confident and relied on his Lord, telling his people that Allah was his ally and supporter, and that he was not going to give them power over him.\nThen he called on the people to bear witness, telling them openly that he was different from them: he disavowed their religion and their gods, on the basis of which they took as allies those who agreed with their beliefs, and they offered their lives and wealth in support of those gods. Then he confirmed this stance when he expressed how little he thought of them, and said words which indicated how much he scorned and despised them. He told them that even if they all came together to scheme against him and take action to vent their anger towards him, and they hastened to punish him and did not grant him any respite, they would not be able to harm him with anything except what Allah had decreed for him.\nThen he reiterated his call to them in a very eloquent manner, by stating that his Lord and their Lord, may He be exalted, in Whose hand were their forelocks, was his ally and protector Who would support him and help him, and that He is on a straight path; He would not forsake the one who put his trust in Him and believed in Him, and He would not let his enemy have the joy of seeing him harmed.\nWhat sign and proof could be better than the signs, proofs and evidence of the prophets? It is a testimony from Allah, may He be glorified, which He explained to His slaves in the most eloquent manner. (End quote from Sharh at-Tahawiyyah, p. 47)\nAl-Qasimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the words of Shu`ayb (peace be upon him), {There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord} [al-A`raf 7:85]:\n{There has come to you clear evidence [bayyinah] from your Lord} means: that which makes truth distinct from falsehood. What is meant is His call and teachings. Hence one of the scholars said that what is meant by bayyinah (translated here as clear evidence) is the coming of Shu`ayb, and that he had no sign except prophethood.\nThose who interpreted bayyinah as referring to proof and evidence, and tangible miracles, suggested that as the prophet was calling people to a religion that they must accept, there had to be evidence through which it would be known whether he was telling the truth, and that cannot be anything but a miracle. He said: The miracle of Shu`ayb is not mention in the Quran, for not all the signs of the prophets are mentioned in the Quran.\nIt is no secret that the word bayyinah is more general in meaning than the word mu`jizah (miracle), according to the scholars. For anyone to whom it becomes clear that what he is following is misguidance, and proof is established for him of the truth to which he is called, proof has come to him, because what proof really means is anything by means of which truth is made distinct from falsehood. This is something that must be understood.

170546,I would like to know whether any of the earlier prophets were aware of any others. What I mean by that is: did Adam (peace be upon him) or the other prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) know about Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before he actually came?,"['Praise be to Allah.With regard to Adam (peace be upon him), he knew about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as we shall see below. It is most likely that he knew about all the prophets among his descendants, as may be understood from the interpretation given by many of the early generations for the phrase {And He taught Adam the names – all of them} [al-Baqarah 2:31]. The foremost among the commentators, Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him), said: I say that the view concerning the meaning of this verse that is most likely to be correct is the view that the names that were taught to Adam were the names of prominent figures among his descendants, and the names of the angels. (End quote) Undoubtedly the prophets are the first prominent figures among the descendants of Adam whose names deserve to be mentioned. And Allah knows best.\nThere is a hadith which was soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which indicates that Adam was aware of his descendant Dawud (peace be upon him).\nImam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad, 2708, that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The first one to make a denial was Adam” – he said it three times. “When Allah created him, He wiped his back and brought forth his progeny, then He presented them to him. He saw among them a man with a bright face, and he said: O Lord, who is this? He said: Your son Dawud. He said: How long will he live? He said: Sixty years. He said: O Lord, increase his lifespan. He said: No, not unless you increase it by giving him some of your lifespan. So he gave him forty years from his own lifespan, and Allah recorded that in a document and called the angels to bear witness. When Allah wanted to take his soul, Adam said: I still have forty years left. It was said to him: You gave them to your son Dawud. But Adam denied it. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, brought out the document and established proof, then He decreed that Dawud (peace be upon him) should complete one hundred years, and He decreed that Adam (peace be upon him) should live for a thousand years.” Shaykh Ahmad Shakir said in Tahqiq al-Musnad: Its isnad is authentic. The commentators on al-Musnad said: It is sound because of corroborating evidence, apart from the words “He decreed that Dawud (peace be upon him) should complete one hundred years, and He decreed that Adam (peace be upon him) should live for a thousand years.”\nAs for the other prophets knowing about our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that is indicated in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{And [remember] when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets, saying: If I give you scripture and wisdom, and there comes to you a Messenger confirming what is with you, then you must believe in him and you must support him. [Allah] said: Do you agree, and take this covenant of Mine as binding upon you? They said: We agree. He said: Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:81].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and his cousin ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: Allah never sent any of the prophets but He took a covenant from him that if He were to send Muhammad when he was still alive, he would believe in him and support him.\nThen he said: The Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the last of the prophets and his message will abide until the Day of Judgement. He is the greatest leader who, if he had lived in any era, it would have been obligatory to obey him, for he takes precedence over all the prophets. Hence he led them in prayer on the night of the Isra’ (night journey) when they gathered in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). He will also be the intercessor on the Day of Resurrection, who will go to the Lord to ask Him to pass judgement. This is the station of praise and honour (al-maqam al-mahmud) which will not be appropriate for anyone except him, and which all the Messengers of strong will will refuse until the people come to him, for he is the one who is singled out for it. (End quote)\nWith regard to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) being aware of all the prophets, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We have already sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you}\xa0[Ghafir 40:73].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is, we have revealed to you concerning some of them their stories with their people and how they disbelieved in them, then the messengers prevailed. {and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you} – they are many times more than those who were mentioned by name. (End quote)\nBut it may be said that Allah gathered them for him on the night of the Isra’ and he led them in prayer, as it is narrated in al-Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I saw myself with a group of the prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them). I saw Musa (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) standing and praying, and I saw ‘Isa ibn Maryam (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) standing and praying, and I saw Ibrahim (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) standing and praying. Then the time for prayer came, so I led them in prayer.”\nAnd it was narrated by Ahmad, 2324, from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ended al-Masjid al-Aqsa, he stood and prayed, then he turned around and saw all the prophets praying with him. Its isnad was classed as authentic by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir, 5/26, and by Ahmad Shakir in his commentary on al-Musnad. Al-Hafiz, in al-Fat-h, 7/209, and others quoted the words of al-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) in ash-Shifa: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led all the prophets in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis. Perhaps he saw them and recognized them, even though Allah did not tell him about some of them in the Quran.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170546/did-the-earlier-prophets-know-about-muhammad-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him
128632,"If a Christian or Jewish person gives me sweets or food or a drink, is it permissible for me to ask whether it is permissible or not, or whether there is pork in it or not? Or should I keep quiet and mention the name of Allah and eat? What I mean is asking one of the Muslim brothers for his opinion about what it contains.","['Praise be to Allah.Permissibility of Accepting Gifts from Non-Muslims in Islam\nIt is permissible to accept a gift from a non-Muslim because he is a relative or neighbour, or for the purpose of softening his heart and calling him to Islam, but it is prohibited if it is done as an act of friendship or love, because Allah Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliya’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust).} [Al-Ma’idah 5:51]\n{O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand”}\xa0[Al `Imran 3:118]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted the invitation of a Jewish woman and ate her food.\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter entitled “Chapter on Accepting Gifts from Mushrikin”, in which he said:\nAbu Hurayrah narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) travelled with Sarah and entered a village in which there was a king or a tyrant. He (the king) said: Give her Hajir (the mother of Isma`il, peace be upon him). And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was given a gift of a sheep containing poison. And Abu Humayd said: The king of Aylah gave the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a white mule and a cloak. And he quoted the story of the Jewish woman who gave the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the poisoned sheep.\nConditions for Eating Meat from Jews and Christians\nIt is permissible to eat meat slaughtered by a Jew or a Christian, subject to certain conditions:\n\nThat it be slaughtered in the same manner as the Muslims; so the throat and oesophagus should be cut and the blood should be allowed to flow. If he kills it by strangling, electric shock or drowning in water, then it is not permissible to eat his meat, just as if a Muslim does that, it is not permissible to eat his meat.\nThe name of Allah should be mentioned over it, and no other name should be mentioned such as the name of Christ or anyone else, because Allah Says (interpretation of the meaning): {Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal)} [Al-An`am 6:121]. And He Says concerning prohibited things (interpretation of the meaning): {He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering)} [Al-Baqarah 2:173]\n\nIf it is not known how the meat was slaughtered or whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not, it is permissible to eat it and he does not have to ask about how it was slaughtered, because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (2057) from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which some people said: O Messenger of Allah, some people bring meat to us and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allah over it or not. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSo it is permissible to eat even if we do not know whether the slaughterer mentioned the name of Allah or not. Similarly, it is permissible to eat even if we do not know whether it was slaughtered in the proper manner or not, because if an action is done by the appropriate people, then in principle it is valid and sound unless there is evidence to the contrary. If we receive some meat from a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian, we should not ask about it and we should not ask how it was slaughtered or whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not. It is halal so long as there is no proof that it is prohibited, and this is one of the ways in which Allah has made things easy for us. (End quote from Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 1/77)\nThis is with regard to things in which proper slaughter is stipulated, such as animals and birds.\nGuidelines for Non-Meat Items: Sweets, Vegetables, and Fish\nWith regard to fish, sweets and vegetables, there is nothing wrong with eating them, unless it is known that something prohibited has been put in them, such as alcohol or lard (pork fat).\nThe ruling of prohibition cannot be confirmed on the basis of doubt. But if a person tries to be careful and only eats that which he knows and is certain that it is free of prohibited things, then this is better.\nThe Jews adhere to the proper method of slaughter, and they avoid pork.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/128632/can-we-accept-food-and-sweets-from-non-muslims

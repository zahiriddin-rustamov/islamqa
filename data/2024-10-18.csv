117725,"Righteous people talk about “moderation in religion,” and secularists talk about “moderation in religion”; even the disbelievers talk about “moderation in religion.” What is “moderation in religion”?","['Praise be to Allah.Nowadays the phrase “Islam is a religion of moderation” has become popular, and it is true; there is evidence for that in the Quran and Sunnah, and in the words of the scholars. But at the same time, we find that there are people who quote this phrase with ulterior motives, and use it as an excuse to water down Islamic rulings on the basis of this phrase. They examine the fundamentals of Islamic teaching in order to try to shake their foundations on the basis of this phrase and their misunderstanding of it.\nSo now this phrase is used in two ways, one of which is true and the other is false.\n-a-\nAs for the true and rightful use of this phrase, it is supported by evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, and the views of Sunni scholars. In the Quran it says that this ummah is “an Ummah [nation, community] justly balanced”; what is meant is that it is the best and most just of nations, and they are the ones who are between the two extremes.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Thus We have made of you an Ummah [nation, community] justly balanced, that you might be witnesses over humankind, and the Messenger might be a witness over you; We prescribed the qiblah towards which you used to face only in order to know those who would follow the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels. It was indeed difficult, except for those whom Allah guided. Allah will never let your faith go to waste, for Allah is to all people Most Compassionate, Most Merciful}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:143].\nImam at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI think that Allah, may He be exalted, only described them as justly balanced because they have a moderate approach to religion, so they are not people of extremes like the Christians, who went to extremes in monasticism and in what they say about ‘Isa, and they do not fall short like the Jews, who tampered with the Book of Allah, killed their prophets, told lies about their Lord and disbelieved in Him. Rather they are people of moderation and justice in matters of religion, so Allah described them in these terms, because the dearest of things to Allah are those that are justly balanced and moderate. (End quote from Tafsir at-Tabari, 3/142).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, reiterating this idea: There are some who go to extremes in the religion of Allah and others who are heedless about it, but the best of the people are those in the middle, who are far above the shortcomings of the negligent and do not go as far as those who overstepped the bounds. Allah, may He be glorified, has made this ummah one that is justly balanced, which is the best and most fair, because it takes a position between two blameworthy parties. Justice is the middle position between extremism and negligence. Trouble only befalls that which is at the extremes, and the middle is protected by those extremities, so the best of things are those that are moderate and in the middle. (Ighathat al-Lahfan, 1/182)\nWhat confirms this meaning is the following examples from the religious texts:\n-1-\nThe supplication of the Muslims in Surat al-Fatihah:\n{Guide us to the straight path –\nThe path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have earned [Your] anger or of those who are astray}\xa0[al-Fatihah 1:6-7].\nThe Muslim repeats this supplication constantly, in prayer and otherwise; in it, he is asking Allah, may He be exalted, to guide him to the path of those upon whom Allah has bestowed favour, namely the prophets and the strong and true in faith (siddiqin), and to protect him from the path of those who earned His anger, namely the Jews who went astray despite their knowledge, and the path of the Christians who were misguided because of their ignorance.\n-2-\nThe zakah collector should not take the best or the worst of a person’s wealth:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave instructions to Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him), when he sent him to Yemen, saying: “…then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them charity (zakah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they accept that, then beware (of taking) the best of their wealth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1425, and Muslim, 130)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, listing what we learn from this hadith: It indicates that it is prohibited for the zakah collector to take the best of their wealth when collecting zakah; rather he should take that which is of average quality. And it is prohibited for the owner of the wealth to give the worst of his wealth. (End quote from Sharh Sahih Muslim, 1/197).\n-3-\nModeration in spending:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, but follow a middle path between the [two]}\n[al-Furqan 25:67].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is, they are not wasteful in their spending, spending more than is necessary, and they are not miserly towards their families, falling short in giving them their dues and not giving them enough. Rather they are moderate and do what is best, for the best of matters are those which are moderate and do not go to either extreme.\n{but follow a middle path between the [two]} – this is like the verse {Do not keep your hand tied to your neck [like a miser], or stretch it forth to its utmost extent [like a squanderer], lest you become blameworthy and destitute} [al-Isra’ 17:29]. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/123-124).\n-b-\nWith regard to misuse of the phrase “Islam is a religion of moderation,” this is what some writers and callers to Islam promote of taking a stand in the middle of two opposite things: and not taking the correct stand as described and enjoined in the religious texts. So, for example, they will stand between Sunnah and innovation (bid`ah), so they do not reject innovation completely or accept Sunnah completely. With regard to the ruling on apostasy, they try to adopt a middle stance, so they do not accept the ruling of asking the apostate to repent [and if he refuses, he is to be executed], and they do not allow apostasy without limits. And they do not reject Sufism completely. Rather they make themselves think that they are being just when they do not deem this group [the Sufis] to be one of the misguided and doomed groups. The same applies to other misguided groups; they even went as far as to adopting a middle stance between Islam and disbelief. Hence you will find such people supporting the idea of holding dialogues that are held to bring believers in tawhid and believers in shirk together, as when efforts are made to bring Sunnis and Shi`ah – or Muslims and disbelievers – together, and as is the case when efforts are made to bring Islam, Christianity and Judaism closer together. By doing so, they are not supporting Islam and the Sunnah, or refuting innovation and disbelief; rather they are devoting their efforts to watering down their religion and compromising on its fundamentals so that their image may be embellished in the media, when they are described as promoters of moderation. Thus they acquire some worldly gains, but that will not benefit them when they meet their Lord; rather that will harm them. Allah caused one of their most prominent figures to be disappointed when he was barred from entering some non-Muslim countries, even though he was one of the most prominent figures who described them as his brethren and even described the Christians of his country as martyrs, and he put a great deal of effort into watering down his religion with fatwas which he claimed were making things easy or were in line with his middle path. All of that did not benefit him in this world. Allah the Almighty indeed spoke the truth: {And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion} [al-Baqarah 2:120].\nThese people and others should understand that moderation and taking the middle path does not mean that the Muslim stands in the middle between two opposite stances; rather it means ensuring that one’s stance is in line with Islamic teachings and judging matters appropriately on the basis of the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah. Moderation means adopting a middle stance between two things that are both wrong and misguided in the first place. As for the one who uses the concept of moderation in an inappropriate way, he is choosing a middle stance regardless, even if one of the two stances in question is Tawhid and the Sunnah; this is wrong.\nAbu’l-Muzaffar as-Sam`ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is recommended to choose a view that stands between two other views. Choosing a path between a view that is extreme and a view that falls short is only more appropriate if it is acceptable; if it is not acceptable, then that should not be done. (End quote from Qawati` al-Adillah fi Usul al-Fiqh, 5/256).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is meant by moderation in religion, or adopting the middle way?\nHe replied: Moderation in religion, or adopting the middle way, means choosing a way between going to extremes and falling short. That includes academic matters and matters of creed, as well as practical matters having to do with acts of worship.\nFor example, in matters of creed, with regard to the names and attributes of Allah, people may be divided into three categories, two that are opposites of one another and one in the middle. One group goes to extremes in the belief that Allah is far beyond anything we know, so they deny names and attributes that Allah has attributed to Himself. Another group goes to extremes in affirming the divine names and attributes, so they affirm the names and attributes that Allah has affirmed for Himself, but they do that by way of believing that they resemble the names and attributes of human beings. The middle group affirms the names and attributes that Allah, may He be exalted, has affirmed for Himself, without believing that there is any resemblance to the names and attributes of human beings; rather they believe that they are different and that there is nothing like unto Allah, may He be exalted, among His creation.\nThis has to do with creed. Similarly, with regard to physical acts of worship, some people go to extremes and do more than is required, and they are very hard on themselves. Others are negligent and heedless, so they neglect a great deal of worship. And the best of matters are those that are moderate.\nThe guideline regarding moderation is that whatever is prescribed in Islamic teachings is to be taken as what is moderate. Whatever is contrary to Islamic teachings cannot be described as moderation; rather it is inclining either towards extremism or towards negligence.\nShaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned five principles in al-‘Aqidah al-Wasitiyyah, through which he explained that with regard to these principles, Ahl as-Sunnah are in the middle amongst groups that follow innovation, so I recommend the questioner to read this book, because it is very useful.

226557,Is it permissible to make snowmen?,"['Praise be to Allah.If the snowman does not have clear facial features such as eyes, a nose and a mouth, and it is merely a three-dimensional figure with no features, like the scarecrows that farmers set up to scare away birds, and signs that are put on roads as a warning of roadworks or construction, then there is nothing wrong with any of that.\nSimilarly, there is nothing wrong with what children do for fun, because such figures are not usually treated with respect (unlike statues and idols) and it is well-known that children have a psychological need to play and have some fun and excitement, especially in places where snow only falls on rare occasions.\nBut if the snowman has clear facial features, then the majority of scholars are of the view that it is prohibited, because of the general meaning of the prohibition on making images, which has been explained in detail in question no.\xa0146628. A similar ruling applies to figures that are made out of dough and other sweets, and so on.\nBut that is undoubtedly less serious than images that are made to last and are less likely to be treated with disrespect than snowmen. It is well-known that prohibitions are of varying degrees and it is well-known that the general meaning of Shar`i evidence prohibits images.\nWhat matters in the case of images is the head. If the head is cut off or the features are erased, the prohibition no longer applies, as Al-Bayhaqi (14580) narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The image is the head; if the head is cut off it is no longer an image.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on\xa0 him) said: If the image is nothing but a body without a head, it is not included in the prohibition, because that is not an image of a living being. (End quote from Al-Mughni, 7/282)\nIn Sunan Abu Dawud (4158), it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and said to me: ‘I came to you last night and nothing kept me from entering but the fact that there were statues at the door …. So tell someone to cut off the heads of the statues that are by the door of the house, so that they will become like trees …’” And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that.\nAl-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi (8/73):\nThis indicates that if the shape of the image is changed, by cutting off the head or dismantling it so that there is nothing left but a vague and unclear shape, there is nothing wrong with that. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the image is not clear, i.e., if it has no eyes, nose, mouth or fingers, then it is not a complete image and it is not competing with the creation of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nAnd he said:\nAs for the issue of that of which no clear image appears, even though there are limbs or a head or neck, but there are no eyes or nose, then there is nothing wrong with it, because it is not competing with the creation of Allah.

215231,I read that the miracle of Nuh was the Flood. How can that be so when the Flood happened after the people disbelieved and rejected his message? What is known is that miracles were given to a prophet so that the people would believe him. The same may be asked with regard to Shu`ayb and Hud (peace be upon them). What was the miracle for each of these three messengers?,"['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThere is no prophet to whom Allah, may He be exalted, did not grant a clear sign to prove the truthfulness of the message that he brought, in order to establish proof against everyone who opposed him.\nAl-Bukhari, 4981, and Muslim, 152, narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is not a single Prophet who was not given signs so that the people would believe in him because of them. but what I have been given is a revelation that Allah has revealed to me, and I hope that I will be the one with the most followers on the Day of Resurrection.”\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words “There is not a single Prophet who was not given…” indicate that every prophet must have had a miracle that would lead anyone who witnessed it to believe that he was a true prophet; he would not be harmed by those who stubbornly refused to believe. What is meant is that every prophet was given one or more signs, so that the people who saw those signs would believe in him because of them. What is meant by signs is miracles; every prophet was given a miracle that was unique to him, and no one else was given the same miracle, with which to challenge his people. The miracle of each prophet was appropriate to the situation of his people. (End quote from Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar, 9/6).\nSecondly:\nIt is not essential for the Quran and Sunnah to mention the miracle of every prophet, because these miracles were not performed for us. No action is expected of us if we learn about it, and we are not required to believe in the true prophets because of their miracles, because those miracles happened in the past and the time for them is over. Rather we believe in the earlier prophets because of the true texts of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which speak of them.\nWhat we must do is know that Allah’s Prophet Nuh, Allah’s Prophet Hud and other Prophets of Allah were sent to their peoples, and they brought proof and clear evidence that was sufficient for them to accept their message and believe in them. We may know about some of their signs and miracles, or we may not know anything about them, just as we know the names and stories of some of the prophets which are mentioned in sound texts, or we may not know the names and stories of some of the prophets of Allah which are not mentioned in the sound religious texts.\nAz-Zajjaaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the words {There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. So give full measure and weight} [al-A`raf 7:85], some of the grammarians said that Shu`ayb had no sign except prophethood, but this is a serious mistake.\nHe said: {There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. So give full measure and weight} [al-A`raf 7:85]. The conjunction fa [translated here as so] indicates what is expected of you after the sign has come to you. How could he say, There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord when he has no sign except prophethood? If there was another sign along with prophethood, he would have brought it to them.\nThe suggestion that he had no sign is mistaken. If someone had claimed to be a prophet without any sign, that would not be accepted from him. But with regard to Shu`ayb, his sign was clear, as he said. But Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has mentioned some of the signs of the prophets in the Quran, and has not mentioned the signs of others. In the case of those whose signs were not mentioned, it cannot be said that they had no signs. (End quote from Ma`ani al-Quran, 2/353-354)\nSee also: Tafsir Ibn `Atiyyah, 2/426.\nThirdly:\nThe miracle of Allah’s Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) was the building of the ark on dry land, which was then able to sail on the waves which were like mountains, after he had warned his people of the Flood.\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning a karamah that was bestowed on Abu Muslim al-Khawlani (may Allah have mercy on him):\nThis is akin to the miracle of Nuh (peace be upon him), when he sailed on the water in the ark which Allah, may He be exalted, had commanded him to build. (End quote from al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, 9/317)\nIt is not valid to object to that by saying, as the questioner did, that the Flood occurred after the people disbelieved and rejected the message, and the miracle was given to the prophet so that the people would believe him, because it may be said in response to this that Nuh (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had warned his people, alerted them and threatened them. Then when there came to them that which they had been warned about, they persisted in their arrogance and did not believe. If they had believed at that point, their faith would have been valid. Do you not see that Nuh (peace be upon him) urged his son to believe and said to him: {O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers} [Hud 11:42]? If his son had come aboard with them, he would have been one of the believers and not one of the disbelievers, and the same would have applied to others. So the miracle happened at the right time, and did not happen after it was too late.\nMoreover, it was one of the greatest of signs and proofs that Allah gave him, for it was clear evidence and sound proof for them, as Allah says:\n{He said, “O my people, what do you think, if I am relying on clear evidence from my Lord while He has bestowed on mercy from Himself but it has been been obscured from your sight, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?\nAnd O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from Allah. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.\nAnd O my people, who would protect me from Allah if I drove them away? Will you not then pay heed?”\nAnd I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of Allah or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those those who are contemptible in your eyes that Allah will never grant them any good. Allah knows best what is in their hearts. Indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers.”\nThey said, “O Noah, you have argued with us for too long. So bring us that with which you are threatening us, if you should be of the truthful”}\xa0[Hud 11:28-32].\nThe story of the proofs and arguments he presented to them is repeated in more than one surah of the Holy Quran.\nHaving said that, there is nothing to rule out the idea that he could have brought them a clear sign, but we have not been told about it or its nature, as noted above.\nSee also the answer to question no. 10470.\nSomething similar may be said about Allah’s Prophet Hud and Allah’s Prophet Shu`ayb (peace be upon them both). Either each of them had a miracle that we do not know about, and Allah has not told us about it, as noted above in the quotation from az-Zajjaj, or his miracle was the argument that he presented to his people and his prevailing over them with his wisdom and eloquent speech.\nIbn Abi’l-`Izz al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nOne of the most subtle of these signs given to the messengers is the sign of Hud, when his people said to him: {O Hud, you have not brought us clear evidence} [Hud 11:53], even though his proof was among the clearest of proof to anyone whom Allah enabled to reflect upon it. Hud pointed that out when he said:\n{I call Allah to witness, and you too are my witnesses, that I disavow all those whom you ascribe as partners\nto Allah. So scheme against me, all of you, and give me no respite.\nI put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature but He holds it [in His control] by its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on a straight path }\xa0[Hud 11:54-56].\nThis is one of the greatest signs: that one man addressed a great nation with these words, without any fear or panic or losing his nerve; rather he was confident and certain in what he said. Thus he called Allah, first and foremost, to witness that he disavowed their religion and the path they were following, like one who was confident and relied on his Lord, telling his people that Allah was his ally and supporter, and that he was not going to give them power over him.\nThen he called on the people to bear witness, telling them openly that he was different from them: he disavowed their religion and their gods, on the basis of which they took as allies those who agreed with their beliefs, and they offered their lives and wealth in support of those gods. Then he confirmed this stance when he expressed how little he thought of them, and said words which indicated how much he scorned and despised them. He told them that even if they all came together to scheme against him and take action to vent their anger towards him, and they hastened to punish him and did not grant him any respite, they would not be able to harm him with anything except what Allah had decreed for him.\nThen he reiterated his call to them in a very eloquent manner, by stating that his Lord and their Lord, may He be exalted, in Whose hand were their forelocks, was his ally and protector Who would support him and help him, and that He is on a straight path; He would not forsake the one who put his trust in Him and believed in Him, and He would not let his enemy have the joy of seeing him harmed.\nWhat sign and proof could be better than the signs, proofs and evidence of the prophets? It is a testimony from Allah, may He be glorified, which He explained to His slaves in the most eloquent manner. (End quote from Sharh at-Tahawiyyah, p. 47)\nAl-Qasimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the words of Shu`ayb (peace be upon him), {There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord} [al-A`raf 7:85]:\n{There has come to you clear evidence [bayyinah] from your Lord} means: that which makes truth distinct from falsehood. What is meant is His call and teachings. Hence one of the scholars said that what is meant by bayyinah (translated here as clear evidence) is the coming of Shu`ayb, and that he had no sign except prophethood.\nThose who interpreted bayyinah as referring to proof and evidence, and tangible miracles, suggested that as the prophet was calling people to a religion that they must accept, there had to be evidence through which it would be known whether he was telling the truth, and that cannot be anything but a miracle. He said: The miracle of Shu`ayb is not mention in the Quran, for not all the signs of the prophets are mentioned in the Quran.\nIt is no secret that the word bayyinah is more general in meaning than the word mu`jizah (miracle), according to the scholars. For anyone to whom it becomes clear that what he is following is misguidance, and proof is established for him of the truth to which he is called, proof has come to him, because what proof really means is anything by means of which truth is made distinct from falsehood. This is something that must be understood.

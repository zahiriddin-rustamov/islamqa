170546,I would like to know whether any of the earlier prophets were aware of any others. What I mean by that is: did Adam (peace be upon him) or the other prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) know about Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) before he actually came?,"['Praise be to Allah.With regard to Adam (peace be upon him), he knew about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as we shall see below. It is most likely that he knew about all the prophets among his descendants, as may be understood from the interpretation given by many of the early generations for the phrase {And He taught Adam the names – all of them} [al-Baqarah 2:31]. The foremost among the commentators, Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him), said: I say that the view concerning the meaning of this verse that is most likely to be correct is the view that the names that were taught to Adam were the names of prominent figures among his descendants, and the names of the angels. (End quote) Undoubtedly the prophets are the first prominent figures among the descendants of Adam whose names deserve to be mentioned. And Allah knows best.\nThere is a hadith which was soundly narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which indicates that Adam was aware of his descendant Dawud (peace be upon him).\nImam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad, 2708, that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The first one to make a denial was Adam” – he said it three times. “When Allah created him, He wiped his back and brought forth his progeny, then He presented them to him. He saw among them a man with a bright face, and he said: O Lord, who is this? He said: Your son Dawud. He said: How long will he live? He said: Sixty years. He said: O Lord, increase his lifespan. He said: No, not unless you increase it by giving him some of your lifespan. So he gave him forty years from his own lifespan, and Allah recorded that in a document and called the angels to bear witness. When Allah wanted to take his soul, Adam said: I still have forty years left. It was said to him: You gave them to your son Dawud. But Adam denied it. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, brought out the document and established proof, then He decreed that Dawud (peace be upon him) should complete one hundred years, and He decreed that Adam (peace be upon him) should live for a thousand years.” Shaykh Ahmad Shakir said in Tahqiq al-Musnad: Its isnad is authentic. The commentators on al-Musnad said: It is sound because of corroborating evidence, apart from the words “He decreed that Dawud (peace be upon him) should complete one hundred years, and He decreed that Adam (peace be upon him) should live for a thousand years.”\nAs for the other prophets knowing about our Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that is indicated in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{And [remember] when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets, saying: If I give you scripture and wisdom, and there comes to you a Messenger confirming what is with you, then you must believe in him and you must support him. [Allah] said: Do you agree, and take this covenant of Mine as binding upon you? They said: We agree. He said: Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses}\xa0[Al ‘Imran 3:81].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and his cousin ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: Allah never sent any of the prophets but He took a covenant from him that if He were to send Muhammad when he was still alive, he would believe in him and support him.\nThen he said: The Messenger Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is the last of the prophets and his message will abide until the Day of Judgement. He is the greatest leader who, if he had lived in any era, it would have been obligatory to obey him, for he takes precedence over all the prophets. Hence he led them in prayer on the night of the Isra’ (night journey) when they gathered in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). He will also be the intercessor on the Day of Resurrection, who will go to the Lord to ask Him to pass judgement. This is the station of praise and honour (al-maqam al-mahmud) which will not be appropriate for anyone except him, and which all the Messengers of strong will will refuse until the people come to him, for he is the one who is singled out for it. (End quote)\nWith regard to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) being aware of all the prophets, Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And We have already sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you}\xa0[Ghafir 40:73].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is, we have revealed to you concerning some of them their stories with their people and how they disbelieved in them, then the messengers prevailed. {and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you} – they are many times more than those who were mentioned by name. (End quote)\nBut it may be said that Allah gathered them for him on the night of the Isra’ and he led them in prayer, as it is narrated in al-Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I saw myself with a group of the prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them). I saw Musa (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) standing and praying, and I saw ‘Isa ibn Maryam (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) standing and praying, and I saw Ibrahim (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) standing and praying. Then the time for prayer came, so I led them in prayer.”\nAnd it was narrated by Ahmad, 2324, from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) ended al-Masjid al-Aqsa, he stood and prayed, then he turned around and saw all the prophets praying with him. Its isnad was classed as authentic by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir, 5/26, and by Ahmad Shakir in his commentary on al-Musnad. Al-Hafiz, in al-Fat-h, 7/209, and others quoted the words of al-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) in ash-Shifa: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led all the prophets in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis. Perhaps he saw them and recognized them, even though Allah did not tell him about some of them in the Quran.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/170546/did-the-earlier-prophets-know-about-muhammad-blessings-and-peace-of-allah-be-upon-him
128632,"If a Christian or Jewish person gives me sweets or food or a drink, is it permissible for me to ask whether it is permissible or not, or whether there is pork in it or not? Or should I keep quiet and mention the name of Allah and eat? What I mean is asking one of the Muslim brothers for his opinion about what it contains.","['Praise be to Allah.Permissibility of Accepting Gifts from Non-Muslims in Islam\nIt is permissible to accept a gift from a non-Muslim because he is a relative or neighbour, or for the purpose of softening his heart and calling him to Islam, but it is prohibited if it is done as an act of friendship or love, because Allah Says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliya’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust).} [Al-Ma’idah 5:51]\n{O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand”}\xa0[Al `Imran 3:118]\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) accepted the invitation of a Jewish woman and ate her food.\nAl-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter entitled “Chapter on Accepting Gifts from Mushrikin”, in which he said:\nAbu Hurayrah narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) travelled with Sarah and entered a village in which there was a king or a tyrant. He (the king) said: Give her Hajir (the mother of Isma`il, peace be upon him). And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was given a gift of a sheep containing poison. And Abu Humayd said: The king of Aylah gave the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) a white mule and a cloak. And he quoted the story of the Jewish woman who gave the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the poisoned sheep.\nConditions for Eating Meat from Jews and Christians\nIt is permissible to eat meat slaughtered by a Jew or a Christian, subject to certain conditions:\n\nThat it be slaughtered in the same manner as the Muslims; so the throat and oesophagus should be cut and the blood should be allowed to flow. If he kills it by strangling, electric shock or drowning in water, then it is not permissible to eat his meat, just as if a Muslim does that, it is not permissible to eat his meat.\nThe name of Allah should be mentioned over it, and no other name should be mentioned such as the name of Christ or anyone else, because Allah Says (interpretation of the meaning): {Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal)} [Al-An`am 6:121]. And He Says concerning prohibited things (interpretation of the meaning): {He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering)} [Al-Baqarah 2:173]\n\nIf it is not known how the meat was slaughtered or whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not, it is permissible to eat it and he does not have to ask about how it was slaughtered, because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (2057) from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which some people said: O Messenger of Allah, some people bring meat to us and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allah over it or not. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Mention the name of Allah over it and eat it.”\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSo it is permissible to eat even if we do not know whether the slaughterer mentioned the name of Allah or not. Similarly, it is permissible to eat even if we do not know whether it was slaughtered in the proper manner or not, because if an action is done by the appropriate people, then in principle it is valid and sound unless there is evidence to the contrary. If we receive some meat from a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian, we should not ask about it and we should not ask how it was slaughtered or whether the name of Allah was mentioned over it or not. It is halal so long as there is no proof that it is prohibited, and this is one of the ways in which Allah has made things easy for us. (End quote from Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 1/77)\nThis is with regard to things in which proper slaughter is stipulated, such as animals and birds.\nGuidelines for Non-Meat Items: Sweets, Vegetables, and Fish\nWith regard to fish, sweets and vegetables, there is nothing wrong with eating them, unless it is known that something prohibited has been put in them, such as alcohol or lard (pork fat).\nThe ruling of prohibition cannot be confirmed on the basis of doubt. But if a person tries to be careful and only eats that which he knows and is certain that it is free of prohibited things, then this is better.\nThe Jews adhere to the proper method of slaughter, and they avoid pork.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/128632/can-we-accept-food-and-sweets-from-non-muslims
235537,"What do you think of someone who says that it is not obligatory to follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in everything, because he was human and he may try to work something out, then get it wrong or get it right?","['Praise be to Allah.Obeying the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is obligatory; in fact it is one of the fundamentals of faith, as the Quran indicates.

If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you [truly] believe in Allah and the Last Day; that is better and more seemly in the end}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:59]\n{Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and be on your guard. But if you turn away, then know that the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey the message in the clearest way}\xa0[al-Ma’idah 5:92]\n{We did not send any Messenger except to be obeyed by Allah’s leave}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:64].\nAllah, may He be exalted, tells us that no one truly believes until he makes the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) judge concerning what he faces in his life of novel events, and he finds no reservation in his heart towards his ruling, and he accepts it wholeheartedly. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:65].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir, 2/349:\nRegarding the words {But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them}: here Allah, may He be exalted, swears by His divine essence that no one truly believes until he refers judgement to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him in all his affairs, for whatever he rules is the truth which the believer must accept wholeheartedly, both inwardly and outwardly. Hence Allah says: {then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}. That is, when they refer to you for judgement, then they must obey you inwardly and not feel any reservations about your verdict, and they must submit to it both outwardly and inwardly. So they should submit to it completely, without any reluctance, objection or dispute, as it is narrated in the hadith: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of you truly believes until his inclinations are in accordance with what I have brought.” (End quote)\nIn his beneficial and blessed book Riyadh as-Salihin, Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter entitled: the Chapter on the command to adhere to the Sunnah and the etiquette learned therefrom.\nIn this chapter, he quoted a number of verses from the Quran which are indicative of this important principle of faith, as clear evidence in which there is no confusion or doubt:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says:\n{Whatever the Messenger gives you [of the gains, or of instructions], accept it, and whatever he forbids to you, refrain from it}\xa0[al-Hashr 59:7]\n{nor does he speak of his own accord;\nIt is but divine inspiration}\xa0[an-Najm 53:3-4]\n{Say: If you love Allah then follow me; Allah will love you and forgive you your sins}\xa0[Al `Imran 3:31]\n{Verily, in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example for those who look with hope to Allah and the Last Day}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:21]\n{But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, then find in their hearts no reservations about your verdicts, but accept them wholeheartedly}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:65]]\n{If you are in dispute over any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:59].\nThe scholars said: What is meant is referring to the Quran and Sunnah.\nAnd Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah}\xa0[an-Nisa’ 4:80]\n{And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path,\nThe path of Allah}\xa0[ash-Shura 42:52-53]\n{So let those who go against his command beware lest some calamity strikes them or a painful punishment befalls them}\xa0[an-Nur 24:63]\n{And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom}\xa0[al-Ahzab 33:34]\nand there are many similar verses. (End quote).\nIn the same chapter, he also quoted a number of hadiths from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) which affirm this principle. These hadiths include the following:\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” It was said: Who would refuse, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari) It is very strange for someone to claim that following the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is not obligatory, when Allah, may He be exalted, has connected guidance and success to following and obeying him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him that you may be guided}\xa0[al-A`raf 7:158]\n{If you obey him, you will be rightly guided. The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message in the clearest way}\xa0[an-Nur 24:54].\nOne of the things that the Muslim must believe is that the Sunnah of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), which is his path – meaning his words and actions regarding religious matters – is infallible.\nIf the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) made a decision on the basis of his personal opinion, and it turned out to be incorrect, revelation would come down straightaway to correct it and show what Allah wanted and what His ruling was concerning a specific, new development. This is what is proven in the Quran, in passages such as the following:\n{It is not befitting for a Prophet to take captives until he has thoroughly suppressed [the enemy] in the land. You desire the fleeting gains of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise.\nWere it not for a prior decree from Allah, a grievous punishment would have befallen you for what you took [of ransom].\nSo enjoy what you have gained in war as lawful and good, but fear Allah; verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful}\n[al-Anfal 8:67-69]\n{It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire\nAnd the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to Abraham that his father was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient}\xa0[at-Tawbah 9:113-114]\n{O Prophet, why do you prohibit [for yourself] that which Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\nAllah has already prescribed for you a way of releasing yourselves from your oaths.

He has not understood the evidence that points to that, and when he objected to this fundamental principle, he has not objected with something that will benefit him or that has anything to do with the issue under discussion.\nWould that this doubter, if he is confused about something, would refer the matter to people of authority, such as the scholars and jurists, so that they could respond to the doubt that he has in his mind.\nMay Allah show us the path of guidance and enable us to follow it.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/235537/he-claims-that-it-is-not-obligatory-to-follow-the-prophet-in-everything
182542,What is the ruling for hair transplants for the beard if it is sparse?,"['Praise be to Allah.Ruling on Beard Hair Transplants in Islam\nIt is not permissible to do hair transplants for the beard unless that is for the purpose of treating a problem and removing a defect, such as if it was lost or there was some deformity because of sickness or burns, for example. That is because transplanting hair for the beard for purposes other than these comes under the heading of changing the creation of Allah.\nEvidence from the Sunnah on Cosmetic Corrections\nEvidence for the permissibility of using cosmetic means to remove or correct an acquired defect is to be found in the report narrated by Abu Dawud (4232), At-Tirmidhi (1770) and An-Nasa’i (5161) from `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Tarafah who said that his grandfather `Arfajah ibn As`ad’s nose was cut off on the day of (the Battle of) Al-Kulab, and he wore a nose made of silver, but it began to stink, so the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him to get a nose made of gold.\nThe Hadith was classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.\nPermissible Scenarios for Beard Hair Transplants\nDr. Salih ibn Muhammad Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: It seems to me that there are two scenarios with regard to the beard:\n\nThe first scenario is where the growth is naturally sparse, in which case it is not permissible to increase it by means of hair transplants for the following reasons:\n\n\nWhat is meant by the command to let the beard grow is to leave the beard alone and not remove anything from it by cutting or shaving. There is nothing in that command to indicate that it is prescribed to increase it by means of hair transplants, and by analogy it is not prescribed to increase it by means of remedies. In fact it is more likely that transplants are not allowed because of the side-effects and complications to which that may lead.\nDoing hair transplants for the beard when there is no need to do so comes under the heading of changing the creation of Allah, may He be Exalted. Simply wanting to look more handsome or to look a certain way is not sufficient to make this change permissible. Moreover, it involves surgery and exposing oneself to side-effects and complications of this surgical procedure.\n\n\nThe second scenario is where the hair of the beard does not increase or it falls out because of sickness or an accident. In this case it seems to me – and Allah knows best – that it is permissible to do a hair transplant for the beard, because this comes under the heading of medical treatment and removing defects, especially if that sickness or accident has left the man looking deformed.

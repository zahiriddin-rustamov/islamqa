118225,"In the [online] reading library, vol. 2, hadith section, in a commentary on Riyadh as-Salihin by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), no. 18, in the chapter on the prohibition on innovations and newly introduced matters, it was narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance leads to the fire.” Narrated by Muslim. And the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.” Narrated by Muslim. I hope that you can explain these two hadiths and how they are connected to one another.","['Praise be to Allah.These two hadiths are among the most important hadiths on the issue of innovation (bid`ah). They are the texts on which the scholars based their definition of innovation and defined its limits and guidelines. If we take into consideration all the narrations of the two hadiths along with other hadiths, we will be able to understand this issue more precisely.\nDr. Muhammad Husayn al-Jizani (may Allah preserve him) said:\nIn the Sunnah there are several hadiths which point to the correct understanding of the word bid`ah (innovation) from a religious point of view. These hadiths include:\n-1-\nThe hadith of al-`Irbad ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4067)\n-2-\nThe hadith of Jabir ibn `Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in his khutbah: “The truest of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of matters are those which are newly introduced, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance leads to the fire.” (This version was narrated by an-Nasa’i in his Sunan, 3/188)\nAs is clear from these two hadiths, innovation (bid`ah) is that which is newly introduced. In order to understand this idea, we should examine what is meant by newly introduced as mentioned in other hadiths. Regarding that there is\n-3-\nThe hadith of `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours anything that is not part of it, it will be rejected.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2697, and Muslim, 1718)\n-4-\nAccording to another report: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718)\nIf we reflect on these four hadiths, we will learn from them the definition of bid`ah and what it really is from the Islamic perspective.\nFrom the Islamic perspective, bid`ah is defined by three unique characteristics, and a thing cannot be regarded as bid`ah according to the teachings of Islam unless it has the three characteristics, which are:\n\nIt is newly introduced.\nThis newly introduced thing is attributed to the religion of Islam.\nThis newly introduced thing has no basis in the religious texts, whether in a specific sense or in general terms.\n\nThere follow further examples of these three characteristics:\n1.. Being newly introduced\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him, “Whoever introduces…” and “Every newly introduced matter is an innovation.”\nWhat these hadiths refer to is introducing something that is newly invented and unprecedented. This includes every newly introduced thing, whether it is blameworthy or praiseworthy, in the field of religion or otherwise.\nBecause the introduction of new things may happen in worldly matters or in religious matters, there should be two other characteristics of the newly introduced thing:\n2.. Being attributed to the religion of Islam\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “into this matter of ours.” What is meant by this “matter” is his religion and teachings.\nWhat is meant by innovation (bid`ah) is that the newly introduced thing is attributed to Islam in one way or another. This is something that may be achieved in one of three ways:\n\nSeeking to draw close to Allah by means of something that He did not prescribe;\ndrifting away from the teachings of Islam;\n\n\nand a third way may be added, which is the means that could lead to innovation.\n\nBy defining innovation in this manner, we exclude new inventions and newly introduced matters pertaining to worldly life, that have nothing to do with religion. We also exclude sins and evil practices that have been introduced, that were not known before. Such things cannot be described as bid`ah, unless they are done by way of seeking to draw close to Allah, or are done in such a way that they give the impression that they are part of religion.\n3.. Not having any basis in the religious texts, whether in a specific sense or general terms\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “that is not part of it” and “that is not in accordance with this matter of ours.”\nThis characteristic excludes newly introduced matters having to do with religion for which there is a basis in the religious texts, either in a general or specific sense.\nThings that were introduced in religion for which there is a basis in the religious texts in general terms include that which is done on the basis of the general interest, such as when the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) collected the Quran.\nA matter that was introduced in this religion and was based on the religious texts in a specific sense was the introduction of praying Tarawih in congregation at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), which was based on a specific religious text. Another example is reviving Islamic teachings that have been abandoned; examples of that may vary greatly from one time and place to another. Another example is remembering Allah in times and places where people are heedless of His remembrance.\nWith regard to the linguistic meaning of the word ihdath (introducing new things), it is valid to describe things that are based on the evidence of religious texts as newly introduced, because these things were originally Islamic practices, so doing them again after they have been abandoned or become unknown is introducing them as new in a relative sense.\nIt is important to note that any newly introduced thing for which there is evidence in the religious texts to prove that it is sound cannot – from an Islamic point of view – be called newly introduced and it is not an innovation (bid`ah), because according to Islamic teachings, things can only be called newly introduced innovations when there is no evidence for them in the religious texts.\nThere follows confirmation of these three guidelines from the words of the scholars:\nIbn Rajab said: If someone introduces something new and attributes it to Islam when there is no basis for it in the religious texts, it is misguidance and has nothing to do with Islam. (Jami` al-`Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/128)\nHe also said: What is meant by innovation is that which is introduced for which there is no basis in the religious text to support it. As for that for which there is a religious text to support it, it is not regarded as innovation in a religious sense, even if it is regarded as innovation in a linguistic sense. (Jami` al-`Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/127)\nIbn Hajar said: What is meant by the words “Every innovation is misguidance” is what is newly introduced with no evidence from the religious texts in either a specific or general sense. (Fat-h al-Bari, 13/254)\nHe also said: This hadith – meaning the hadith “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours anything that is not part of it, it will be rejected” – is regarded as one of the fundamentals and basic principles of Islam. If someone invents anything in religion for which there is no reference in any of the basic teachings of Islam, no attention should be paid to it. (Fat-h al-Bari, 5/302).\nFrom the above, we may define what is meant by innovation (bid`ah) in Islamic teachings: it is that to which all the three guidelines mentioned above apply. These guidelines may be summed up by saying:\nInnovation is that which is newly introduced into the religion of Allah, for which there is no religious text which may support it in either general or specific terms.\nMore concisely: it is that which is newly introduced into the religion without any evidence.

117725,"Righteous people talk about “moderation in religion,” and secularists talk about “moderation in religion”; even the disbelievers talk about “moderation in religion.” What is “moderation in religion”?","['Praise be to Allah.Nowadays the phrase “Islam is a religion of moderation” has become popular, and it is true; there is evidence for that in the Quran and Sunnah, and in the words of the scholars. But at the same time, we find that there are people who quote this phrase with ulterior motives, and use it as an excuse to water down Islamic rulings on the basis of this phrase. They examine the fundamentals of Islamic teaching in order to try to shake their foundations on the basis of this phrase and their misunderstanding of it.\nSo now this phrase is used in two ways, one of which is true and the other is false.\n-a-\nAs for the true and rightful use of this phrase, it is supported by evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, and the views of Sunni scholars. In the Quran it says that this ummah is “an Ummah [nation, community] justly balanced”; what is meant is that it is the best and most just of nations, and they are the ones who are between the two extremes.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Thus We have made of you an Ummah [nation, community] justly balanced, that you might be witnesses over humankind, and the Messenger might be a witness over you; We prescribed the qiblah towards which you used to face only in order to know those who would follow the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels. It was indeed difficult, except for those whom Allah guided. Allah will never let your faith go to waste, for Allah is to all people Most Compassionate, Most Merciful}\xa0[al-Baqarah 2:143].\nImam at-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nI think that Allah, may He be exalted, only described them as justly balanced because they have a moderate approach to religion, so they are not people of extremes like the Christians, who went to extremes in monasticism and in what they say about ‘Isa, and they do not fall short like the Jews, who tampered with the Book of Allah, killed their prophets, told lies about their Lord and disbelieved in Him. Rather they are people of moderation and justice in matters of religion, so Allah described them in these terms, because the dearest of things to Allah are those that are justly balanced and moderate. (End quote from Tafsir at-Tabari, 3/142).\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, reiterating this idea: There are some who go to extremes in the religion of Allah and others who are heedless about it, but the best of the people are those in the middle, who are far above the shortcomings of the negligent and do not go as far as those who overstepped the bounds. Allah, may He be glorified, has made this ummah one that is justly balanced, which is the best and most fair, because it takes a position between two blameworthy parties. Justice is the middle position between extremism and negligence. Trouble only befalls that which is at the extremes, and the middle is protected by those extremities, so the best of things are those that are moderate and in the middle. (Ighathat al-Lahfan, 1/182)\nWhat confirms this meaning is the following examples from the religious texts:\n-1-\nThe supplication of the Muslims in Surat al-Fatihah:\n{Guide us to the straight path –\nThe path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have earned [Your] anger or of those who are astray}\xa0[al-Fatihah 1:6-7].\nThe Muslim repeats this supplication constantly, in prayer and otherwise; in it, he is asking Allah, may He be exalted, to guide him to the path of those upon whom Allah has bestowed favour, namely the prophets and the strong and true in faith (siddiqin), and to protect him from the path of those who earned His anger, namely the Jews who went astray despite their knowledge, and the path of the Christians who were misguided because of their ignorance.\n-2-\nThe zakah collector should not take the best or the worst of a person’s wealth:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave instructions to Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him), when he sent him to Yemen, saying: “…then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them charity (zakah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they accept that, then beware (of taking) the best of their wealth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1425, and Muslim, 130)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, listing what we learn from this hadith: It indicates that it is prohibited for the zakah collector to take the best of their wealth when collecting zakah; rather he should take that which is of average quality. And it is prohibited for the owner of the wealth to give the worst of his wealth. (End quote from Sharh Sahih Muslim, 1/197).\n-3-\nModeration in spending:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, but follow a middle path between the [two]}\n[al-Furqan 25:67].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: That is, they are not wasteful in their spending, spending more than is necessary, and they are not miserly towards their families, falling short in giving them their dues and not giving them enough. Rather they are moderate and do what is best, for the best of matters are those which are moderate and do not go to either extreme.\n{but follow a middle path between the [two]} – this is like the verse {Do not keep your hand tied to your neck [like a miser], or stretch it forth to its utmost extent [like a squanderer], lest you become blameworthy and destitute} [al-Isra’ 17:29]. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/123-124).\n-b-\nWith regard to misuse of the phrase “Islam is a religion of moderation,” this is what some writers and callers to Islam promote of taking a stand in the middle of two opposite things: and not taking the correct stand as described and enjoined in the religious texts. So, for example, they will stand between Sunnah and innovation (bid`ah), so they do not reject innovation completely or accept Sunnah completely. With regard to the ruling on apostasy, they try to adopt a middle stance, so they do not accept the ruling of asking the apostate to repent [and if he refuses, he is to be executed], and they do not allow apostasy without limits. And they do not reject Sufism completely. Rather they make themselves think that they are being just when they do not deem this group [the Sufis] to be one of the misguided and doomed groups. The same applies to other misguided groups; they even went as far as to adopting a middle stance between Islam and disbelief. Hence you will find such people supporting the idea of holding dialogues that are held to bring believers in tawhid and believers in shirk together, as when efforts are made to bring Sunnis and Shi`ah – or Muslims and disbelievers – together, and as is the case when efforts are made to bring Islam, Christianity and Judaism closer together. By doing so, they are not supporting Islam and the Sunnah, or refuting innovation and disbelief; rather they are devoting their efforts to watering down their religion and compromising on its fundamentals so that their image may be embellished in the media, when they are described as promoters of moderation. Thus they acquire some worldly gains, but that will not benefit them when they meet their Lord; rather that will harm them. Allah caused one of their most prominent figures to be disappointed when he was barred from entering some non-Muslim countries, even though he was one of the most prominent figures who described them as his brethren and even described the Christians of his country as martyrs, and he put a great deal of effort into watering down his religion with fatwas which he claimed were making things easy or were in line with his middle path. All of that did not benefit him in this world. Allah the Almighty indeed spoke the truth: {And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion} [al-Baqarah 2:120].\nThese people and others should understand that moderation and taking the middle path does not mean that the Muslim stands in the middle between two opposite stances; rather it means ensuring that one’s stance is in line with Islamic teachings and judging matters appropriately on the basis of the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah. Moderation means adopting a middle stance between two things that are both wrong and misguided in the first place. As for the one who uses the concept of moderation in an inappropriate way, he is choosing a middle stance regardless, even if one of the two stances in question is Tawhid and the Sunnah; this is wrong.\nAbu’l-Muzaffar as-Sam`ani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is recommended to choose a view that stands between two other views. Choosing a path between a view that is extreme and a view that falls short is only more appropriate if it is acceptable; if it is not acceptable, then that should not be done. (End quote from Qawati` al-Adillah fi Usul al-Fiqh, 5/256).\nShaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is meant by moderation in religion, or adopting the middle way?\nHe replied: Moderation in religion, or adopting the middle way, means choosing a way between going to extremes and falling short. That includes academic matters and matters of creed, as well as practical matters having to do with acts of worship.\nFor example, in matters of creed, with regard to the names and attributes of Allah, people may be divided into three categories, two that are opposites of one another and one in the middle. One group goes to extremes in the belief that Allah is far beyond anything we know, so they deny names and attributes that Allah has attributed to Himself. Another group goes to extremes in affirming the divine names and attributes, so they affirm the names and attributes that Allah has affirmed for Himself, but they do that by way of believing that they resemble the names and attributes of human beings. The middle group affirms the names and attributes that Allah, may He be exalted, has affirmed for Himself, without believing that there is any resemblance to the names and attributes of human beings; rather they believe that they are different and that there is nothing like unto Allah, may He be exalted, among His creation.\nThis has to do with creed. Similarly, with regard to physical acts of worship, some people go to extremes and do more than is required, and they are very hard on themselves. Others are negligent and heedless, so they neglect a great deal of worship. And the best of matters are those that are moderate.\nThe guideline regarding moderation is that whatever is prescribed in Islamic teachings is to be taken as what is moderate. Whatever is contrary to Islamic teachings cannot be described as moderation; rather it is inclining either towards extremism or towards negligence.\nShaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned five principles in al-‘Aqidah al-Wasitiyyah, through which he explained that with regard to these principles, Ahl as-Sunnah are in the middle amongst groups that follow innovation, so I recommend the questioner to read this book, because it is very useful.

226557,Is it permissible to make snowmen?,"['Praise be to Allah.If the snowman does not have clear facial features such as eyes, a nose and a mouth, and it is merely a three-dimensional figure with no features, like the scarecrows that farmers set up to scare away birds, and signs that are put on roads as a warning of roadworks or construction, then there is nothing wrong with any of that.\nSimilarly, there is nothing wrong with what children do for fun, because such figures are not usually treated with respect (unlike statues and idols) and it is well-known that children have a psychological need to play and have some fun and excitement, especially in places where snow only falls on rare occasions.\nBut if the snowman has clear facial features, then the majority of scholars are of the view that it is prohibited, because of the general meaning of the prohibition on making images, which has been explained in detail in question no.\xa0146628. A similar ruling applies to figures that are made out of dough and other sweets, and so on.\nBut that is undoubtedly less serious than images that are made to last and are less likely to be treated with disrespect than snowmen. It is well-known that prohibitions are of varying degrees and it is well-known that the general meaning of Shar`i evidence prohibits images.\nWhat matters in the case of images is the head. If the head is cut off or the features are erased, the prohibition no longer applies, as Al-Bayhaqi (14580) narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The image is the head; if the head is cut off it is no longer an image.\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on\xa0 him) said: If the image is nothing but a body without a head, it is not included in the prohibition, because that is not an image of a living being. (End quote from Al-Mughni, 7/282)\nIn Sunan Abu Dawud (4158), it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and said to me: ‘I came to you last night and nothing kept me from entering but the fact that there were statues at the door …. So tell someone to cut off the heads of the statues that are by the door of the house, so that they will become like trees …’” And the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did that.\nAl-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi (8/73):\nThis indicates that if the shape of the image is changed, by cutting off the head or dismantling it so that there is nothing left but a vague and unclear shape, there is nothing wrong with that. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIf the image is not clear, i.e., if it has no eyes, nose, mouth or fingers, then it is not a complete image and it is not competing with the creation of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.\nAnd he said:\nAs for the issue of that of which no clear image appears, even though there are limbs or a head or neck, but there are no eyes or nose, then there is nothing wrong with it, because it is not competing with the creation of Allah.

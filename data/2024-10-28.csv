100268,"I am suffering from strong Waswas in all my acts of worship, especially istinja (cleansing after relieving myself). When I use the toilet, I just spend too long a time. It became a very hateful place to me for whatever reason. Every time I enter the toilet I cry because of how strong this Waswas is. I do not feel sure of my Tuhr (purification) at all. Many things put doubt in my heart, like when my hand touches a tahir (clean) place after I washed a najis (unclean) place, so I have to wash that position as well. Also when the water of istinja sprinkles on my feet and body I doubt my Tuhr so I have to wash them after finishing.","['Praise be to Allah.Understanding the Source of Whispers in Prayer\nWhat the questioner mentions has to do with a kind of WaswasWaswas (whispers from the devil), because purification and prayer are simple matters that do not need such concern. The religion of Allah is easy and there is no hardship in it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty.}\xa0[Al-Hajj 22:78]\n{Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.}\xa0[Al-Baqarah 2:185]\nAnd the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the glad tidings that you will be rewarded.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 39)\nOvercoming Shaytan’s Whispers during prayer\nThe remedy for whispers in prayer involves three things:\n\nConstantly persisting in remembering Allah, may He be Exalted.\nTurning to Him and asking Him for healing and recovery from this problem.\nTurning away completely from what the Waswas is calling you to do. So when you have relieved yourself and washed yourself (Istinja’), get up and do not pay any attention to whether your hand touched a pure place after touching the impurity, or that drops of the Istinja’ water landed on your feet or body, because the basic principle is that things remain pure, and uncertainty as to whether your body or clothes have become impure does not have any effect.\n\nYou should understand that your body and clothes, the place where you pray, and other things are pure and continue to be regarded as pure unless we are certain that they have become impure. As for doubts, imagination and Waswas, no attention should be paid to them.\nPurification and removal of impurity is done by washing the private part; it is not essential to wash the area around it, so do not pay any attention to the water that drops elsewhere, as stated above.\nBe confident that you are pure, praise be to Allah, and that your prayer offered with this purification is valid and accepted, if Allah wills, for Allah is Most Merciful and Kind, and He shows mercy to His sinful slaves, so how about those who are obedient and love Him?\nWith regard to deciding to stop Wudu or prayer, that does not matter either, rather you should ignore these thoughts and carry on with your Wudu or prayer, because there is no reason to interrupt an act of worship, rather this is Waswas and it does not affect your act of worship, praise be to Allah. No matter what thoughts of interrupting your act of worship or repeating it come to you, do not pay any attention to that, and carry on with it, and ask Allah to accept it, because you have done as much as you could, and you have done what was required of you, and Allah does not burden any person beyond his scope.\nRemember this advice, and carry on, and ignore the Waswas, for it is a trick of the devil, but his tricks are weak as our Lord has told us. Be confident that if you ignore the Waswas it will disappear, by the power of Allah.\nWe ask Allah to help you to obey Him and to make you happy by worshipping Him, and to take away the problem that you are facing.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/100268/how-to-stop-whispers-during-prayer
118225,"In the [online] reading library, vol. 2, hadith section, in a commentary on Riyadh as-Salihin by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), no. 18, in the chapter on the prohibition on innovations and newly introduced matters, it was narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance leads to the fire.” Narrated by Muslim. And the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.” Narrated by Muslim. I hope that you can explain these two hadiths and how they are connected to one another.","['Praise be to Allah.These two hadiths are among the most important hadiths on the issue of innovation (bid`ah). They are the texts on which the scholars based their definition of innovation and defined its limits and guidelines. If we take into consideration all the narrations of the two hadiths along with other hadiths, we will be able to understand this issue more precisely.\nDr. Muhammad Husayn al-Jizani (may Allah preserve him) said:\nIn the Sunnah there are several hadiths which point to the correct understanding of the word bid`ah (innovation) from a religious point of view. These hadiths include:\n-1-\nThe hadith of al-`Irbad ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4067)\n-2-\nThe hadith of Jabir ibn `Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in his khutbah: “The truest of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of matters are those which are newly introduced, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance leads to the fire.” (This version was narrated by an-Nasa’i in his Sunan, 3/188)\nAs is clear from these two hadiths, innovation (bid`ah) is that which is newly introduced. In order to understand this idea, we should examine what is meant by newly introduced as mentioned in other hadiths. Regarding that there is\n-3-\nThe hadith of `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), in which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours anything that is not part of it, it will be rejected.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2697, and Muslim, 1718)\n-4-\nAccording to another report: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, it will be rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718)\nIf we reflect on these four hadiths, we will learn from them the definition of bid`ah and what it really is from the Islamic perspective.\nFrom the Islamic perspective, bid`ah is defined by three unique characteristics, and a thing cannot be regarded as bid`ah according to the teachings of Islam unless it has the three characteristics, which are:\n\nIt is newly introduced.\nThis newly introduced thing is attributed to the religion of Islam.\nThis newly introduced thing has no basis in the religious texts, whether in a specific sense or in general terms.\n\nThere follow further examples of these three characteristics:\n1.. Being newly introduced\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him, “Whoever introduces…” and “Every newly introduced matter is an innovation.”\nWhat these hadiths refer to is introducing something that is newly invented and unprecedented. This includes every newly introduced thing, whether it is blameworthy or praiseworthy, in the field of religion or otherwise.\nBecause the introduction of new things may happen in worldly matters or in religious matters, there should be two other characteristics of the newly introduced thing:\n2.. Being attributed to the religion of Islam\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “into this matter of ours.” What is meant by this “matter” is his religion and teachings.\nWhat is meant by innovation (bid`ah) is that the newly introduced thing is attributed to Islam in one way or another. This is something that may be achieved in one of three ways:\n\nSeeking to draw close to Allah by means of something that He did not prescribe;\ndrifting away from the teachings of Islam;\n\n\nand a third way may be added, which is the means that could lead to innovation.\n\nBy defining innovation in this manner, we exclude new inventions and newly introduced matters pertaining to worldly life, that have nothing to do with religion. We also exclude sins and evil practices that have been introduced, that were not known before. Such things cannot be described as bid`ah, unless they are done by way of seeking to draw close to Allah, or are done in such a way that they give the impression that they are part of religion.\n3.. Not having any basis in the religious texts, whether in a specific sense or general terms\nThe evidence for this guideline is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), “that is not part of it” and “that is not in accordance with this matter of ours.”\nThis characteristic excludes newly introduced matters having to do with religion for which there is a basis in the religious texts, either in a general or specific sense.\nThings that were introduced in religion for which there is a basis in the religious texts in general terms include that which is done on the basis of the general interest, such as when the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) collected the Quran.\nA matter that was introduced in this religion and was based on the religious texts in a specific sense was the introduction of praying Tarawih in congregation at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), which was based on a specific religious text. Another example is reviving Islamic teachings that have been abandoned; examples of that may vary greatly from one time and place to another. Another example is remembering Allah in times and places where people are heedless of His remembrance.\nWith regard to the linguistic meaning of the word ihdath (introducing new things), it is valid to describe things that are based on the evidence of religious texts as newly introduced, because these things were originally Islamic practices, so doing them again after they have been abandoned or become unknown is introducing them as new in a relative sense.\nIt is important to note that any newly introduced thing for which there is evidence in the religious texts to prove that it is sound cannot – from an Islamic point of view – be called newly introduced and it is not an innovation (bid`ah), because according to Islamic teachings, things can only be called newly introduced innovations when there is no evidence for them in the religious texts.\nThere follows confirmation of these three guidelines from the words of the scholars:\nIbn Rajab said: If someone introduces something new and attributes it to Islam when there is no basis for it in the religious texts, it is misguidance and has nothing to do with Islam. (Jami` al-`Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/128)\nHe also said: What is meant by innovation is that which is introduced for which there is no basis in the religious text to support it. As for that for which there is a religious text to support it, it is not regarded as innovation in a religious sense, even if it is regarded as innovation in a linguistic sense. (Jami` al-`Ulum wa’l-Hikam, 2/127)\nIbn Hajar said: What is meant by the words “Every innovation is misguidance” is what is newly introduced with no evidence from the religious texts in either a specific or general sense. (Fat-h al-Bari, 13/254)\nHe also said: This hadith – meaning the hadith “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours anything that is not part of it, it will be rejected” – is regarded as one of the fundamentals and basic principles of Islam. If someone invents anything in religion for which there is no reference in any of the basic teachings of Islam, no attention should be paid to it. (Fat-h al-Bari, 5/302).\nFrom the above, we may define what is meant by innovation (bid`ah) in Islamic teachings: it is that to which all the three guidelines mentioned above apply. These guidelines may be summed up by saying:\nInnovation is that which is newly introduced into the religion of Allah, for which there is no religious text which may support it in either general or specific terms.\nMore concisely: it is that which is newly introduced into the religion without any evidence.

85622,What is meant by lowering the gaze?,"['Praise be to Allah.Linguistic meaning of lowering the gaze\nLowering the gaze (Ghadd Al-basar) means restraining the gaze and not allowing it to wander or dwell upon anything.\nIbn Faris said in Mu`jam Maqayis Al-Lughah (4/307):\xa0“Ghayn and dad indicate restraining, as in the phrase Ghadd Al-basar (lowering the gaze)…”\nIbn Al-Manzur said in Lisan Al-`Arab (7/196):\xa0“Lowering the gaze (Ghadd Al-basr) means restraining it.”\nThe Islamic meaning of lowering the gaze\nIn Islamic terminology lowering the gaze refers to a number of things:\n\nRefraining from looking at people’s `Awrahs, which includes the beauty of a non-mahram woman.\n\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (15/414):\n“Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has enjoined us in His Book to lower the gaze, which is of two types: refraining from looking at `Awrahs and refraining from looking at the site of desire.\nThe former refers to a man refraining from looking at the `Awrah of another person.\nThe second refers to looking at uncovered parts of a non-mahram woman. This is more serious than the former, just as alcohol is more serious than dead meat and blood and pork, and the hadd punishment should be carried out on the one who drinks it, because these prohibited things are not as desirable as alcohol may be.”\n\nRefraining from looking into people’s houses and things that are behind closed doors.\n\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) says in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (15/379):\nJust as lowering the gaze includes not looking at the `Awrahs of other people and other prohibited things, it also includes refraining from looking into people’s houses. A man’s house conceals his body just as his garments conceal him. Allah has mentioned lowering the gaze and guarding one’s private parts after the verse about asking for permission to enter, because the house covers a person just as the clothes on his body do. End quote.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Madarij As-Salikin (1/117):\n“Prohibited kinds of looking include looking at `Awrahs, which is of two types: the `Awrah behind a garment and the `Awrah behind doors.” (End quote)\n\nRefraining from looking at what people have of wealth, wives, children, worldly goods and so on.\n\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Look not with your eyes ambitiously at what We have bestowed on certain classes of them (the disbelievers), nor grieve over them. And lower your wings for the believers (be courteous to the fellow-believers).” [Al-Hijr 15:88]\nIbn Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir (434):\n“This means, do not admire them in such a way that you will distracted with desire for the worldly pleasures enjoyed by those who live in luxury and by which the ignorant are deceived. You should be content with that which Allah has given you of the seven oft-repeated verses and the Holy Quran (cf. Al-Hijr 15:87). (End quote)\nHe also said (p. 516):\n“This means,\xa0 do not be impressed and do not look repeatedly admiring worldly pleasures and those who are enjoying them, such as delicious food and drink, fine clothing, beautiful houses and adorned women, for all of that is the adornment of this world in which those who are deceived rejoice. And those who do wrong enjoy it by ignoring the Hereafter. But it will all soon end and cease to be, and those who love it will die, then they will regret when regret will be to no avail, and they will realize the state they are in when the Resurrection begins. Allah has made it a test and a trial, so that it may be known who will be deceived by it and who will be better in deeds. (End quote)\nBenefits of lowering the gaze\nThe scholars have mentioned many benefits of lowering the gaze, including the following:\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jawab Al-Kafi (125):\n“There are a number of benefits in lowering the gaze:\n\nIt is obedience to the command of Allah, which brings happiness to man in this world and in the next. There is nothing more beneficial to a person in this world and in the next than obeying the commands of his Lord, may He be Blessed and Exalted, and those who are happy in this world and the next can only attain that happiness by obeying His commands, and those who are doomed in this world and in the next are only doomed because they ignore His commands.\nIt prevents the poisoned arrows (of the devil), which may lead to his doom, from reaching his heart.\nIt creates a heart that is devoted to and focused on Allah. Letting the gaze wander distracts the heart and keeps it far from Allah. There is nothing more harmful to a person than letting his gaze wander, as it creates alienation between a person and his Lord.\nIt strengthens the heart and brings it peace, just as letting the gaze wander weakens it and makes it sad.\nIt brings light to the heart, just as letting the gaze wander brings darkness to it. Hence Allah mentioned the verse of light immediately after the command to lower the gaze, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts…} [An-Nur 24:30]\nThen straight after that He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp.} [An-Nur 24:35]\ni.e., the likeness of His light in the heart of His believing slave who obeys His commands and heeds His prohibitions. If the heart is enlightened blessings will come to it from all sides, but if it is darkened, calamity and evil will come to it from all places. Whatever exists of innovation, misguidance, following whims and desires, avoiding true guidance and turning away from the means of happiness and focusing on the means that lead to doom, that will be recognizable by means of the light that is in the heart. If that light is lost then one will left like a blind man stumbling in the darkness.\n\nIt generates true insight which can distinguish between truth and falsehood, sincerity and lies. Allah rewards His slave for his good deeds with something similar and if he gives up something for the sake of Allah, He will compensate him with something better than it. So if he lowers his gaze and refrains from looking at things that Allah has forbidden, Allah will compensate him with enlightenment; he will compensate him for restraining his gaze for the sake of Allah, and will open to him the doors of knowledge, faith and true insight which he only attained by means of the light in his heart. The opposite of that is the blindness which Allah attributed to the homosexuals, which is the opposite of insight. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{Verily, by your life (O Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.} [Al-Hijr 15:72]\n\nIt creates a heart that is steadfast, brave and strong. Allah will give him both insight and power and strength, as it says in the report: “The one who goes against his whims and desires, the devil flees from his shadow.”\n\nOn the other hand, the one who follows his whims and desires will feel a sense of humiliation, indignity, worthlessness and insignificance, which is the punishment which Allah has decreed for those who disobey Him as Al-Hasan said: “Even if they ride the finest of mounts, the effect of sin will never depart from them. Allah insists that the one who disobeys Him will be humiliated.”\nAllah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, has connected strength to obedience to Him, and humiliation to disobedience to Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{But honour, power and glory belong to Allah, and to His Messenger (Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and to the believers.} [Al-Munafiqun 63:8]\n{So do not become weak (against your enemy), nor be sad, and you will be superior (in victory) if you are indeed (true) believers.} [Al `Imran 3:139]\nFaith is both words and deeds, inward and outward. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Whosoever desires honour, power and glory then to Allah belongs all honour, power and glory [and one can get honour, power and glory only by obeying and worshipping Allah (Alone)]. To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allah unless and until they are followed by good deeds)} [Fatir 35:10]\ni.e., whoever desires power, let him seek it by means of obedience to Allah and remembrance of Him, by speaking good words and doing good deeds. In Du’a’ Al-Qunut it says: “he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, nor is he honoured who You take as an enemy”. Whoever obeys Allah is His friend in as much as he obeys Him, and he will have support and honour from Him commensurate with his obedience towards Him. Whoever disobeys Him is His enemy in as much as he disobeys Him, and he will have humiliation from Him commensurate with his disobedience towards Him.\n\nIt blocks the devil from a means of entering his heart, for he may enter with looking, and penetrate the heart faster than the wind blowing through an empty space, and he may present to him the image that he looked at and make it attractive, like an idol to which his heart becomes devoted, then he encourages him and gives him hopes, and fans the flames of desire in his heart, adding the fuel of sin which could not have reached his heart without looking at that image. So his heart becomes inflamed and surrounded with fire on all sides, resulting in infatuation and frustration, and he is in the midst of it like a lamb in the oven. Hence the punishment for those whose desires were fuelled by prohibited looking is that in Al-Barzakh they are placed in an oven of fire.\nIt distracts one from thinking of what is in one’s best interests, so his affairs become neglected and he follows his whims and desires and neglects to remember his Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n{and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and who follows his own lusts, and whose affair (deeds) has been lost.} [Al-Kahf 18:28]\n\nBetween the eyes and the heart there is a connection which means that the one is affected by the other, and if one of them becomes good, the other will also become good, and if one becomes corrupt the other will become corrupt. If the heart becomes corrupt the gaze will become corrupt, and if the gaze becomes corrupt the heart will become corrupt, and similarly if one is sound the other will also be sound.” (End quote)\n\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 113996, 126925, 160554, 49024, and 21784.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/85622/meaning-of-lowering-the-gaze

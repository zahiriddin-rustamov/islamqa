376756,"How authentic is this hadith? “It was narrated that Zaid bin Al-Arqam said:
I heard the Messenger of Allah say: ‘Whoever does not take from his mustache, he is not one of us.’”?
2) If it is authentic, does this mean that trimming your mustache is fard?
3) There is a hadith that says “Do the opposite of what the polytheists do ; let the beard grow long and clip the moustache.” From this hadith, scholars said that keeping the beard is fard, so why is cutting the mustache a sunnah when it is mentioned in the same hadith? Why did scholars say that part of the hadith is an obligation whereas the other part is a sunnah, arent both of them commands from the prophet?","['Praise be to Allah.Trimming the moustache is one of the proven sunnahs of the fitrah (sound human inclination).\nIbn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe reports that are soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) indicate that trimming the moustache and nails is part of the fitrah (sound human inclination), and that he enjoined trimming the moustache and letting the beard grow.\nEnd quote from al-Awsat, 1/238.\nBut the scholars differed to the degree to which it is prescribed: is it a recommended sunnah or is it an obligatory action?\nSome of the scholars were of the view that it is obligatory, and this is what is implied by the apparent meaning of the two hadiths referred to.\nIbn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nand he should trim his moustache… Ibn Hazm narrated that there was consensus that trimming the moustache and letting the beard growth is obligatory.\nOur companions and others said that it is recommended, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed us to do that, as he said: “And be different from the polytheists.” (al-Bukhari and Muslim). Muslim narrated that he said: “Be different from the Zoroastrians.” It was narrated from Zayd ibn Arqam in a marfu‘ report: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us.” Narrated by Ahmad, an-Nasa’i and at-Tirmidhi and classed as authentic by the latter. This version, according to our companions, indicates that it is prohibited.\nEnd quote from al-Furu‘, 1/151-152.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAs for trimming the moustache, the evidence indicates that it is obligatory to trim it when it becomes long, and this is the correct view, because the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) enjoined that, and because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us.”\nEnd quote from Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 257.\nShaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Ali Adam al-Ethiopi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIbn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted this hadith, the hadith “and trim the moustache,” and similar evidence for it being obligatory to trim the moustache, as noted in al-Fat-h. In al-Manhal he added: Some of the Hanafis and the majority of scholars are of the view that it is recommended. Then he said: What is more likely to be correct is the first view. And Allah knows best.\nEnd quote from Dhakhirat al-‘Uqba, 1/380.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that it is sunnah, and they think that the two hadiths referred to do not say that it is obligatory to remove something from the moustache by cutting or shaving.\nWith regard to the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam, according to which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us,” it was narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 2761, and others. A number of scholars stated that it is authentic, including at-Tirmidhi who said, after narrating the hadith: This is an authentic, sound hadith.\nThey thought that what was meant by the phrase “is not one of us” is that he is not following our guidance and path.\nAl-‘Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe hadith of a man from Banu Ghifar, “Whoever does not shave his pubic hair, clip his nails and trim his moustache is not one of us,” indicates that doing these things is obligatory.\nThe response to that is twofold:\nFirstly, this hadith is not proven, because its isnad includes Ibn Luhay`ah, and the scholarly reservations about him are well known. Rather only the part about trimming the moustache is proven, as was narrated and classed authentic by at-Tirmidhi, and was also narrated by an-Nasa’i, from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever does not remove anything from his moustache is not one of us.”\nSecondly, what is meant – assuming that it is soundly narrated – is that he is not following our path, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who does not recite the Qur’an in a melodious voice.” This is definitely the intended meaning, and Allah knows best.\nEnd quote from Tarh at-Tathrib, 2/82.\nRegarding the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Be different from the polytheists: let your beard grow and trim your moustaches” (al-Bukhari, 5829; Muslim, 259),\nthey thought that the view that it is obligatory to let the beard grow and that it is prohibited to shave it does not necessarily imply that it is obligatory to cut the moustache and is prohibited to leave it, because the fact that these things are mentioned together in this command does not mean that they are equal in the degree of the command, as is the view of the majority of scholars of usul al-fiqh.\nAz-Zarkashi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to the two phrases being mentioned together, it does not mean that they are equal to other rulings that are not mentioned, in contrast to the view of Abu Yusuf and al-Muzani.\nCommentary: the fact that the two things are mentioned together \xa0with regard to a ruling does not mean that they are equal to other rulings that are not mentioned. Hence what is obligatory may be mentioned after something that is recommended, as in the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Eat of [each of] its fruit when it yields and give its due [zakah] on the day of its harvest}\n[al-An`am 6:141].\nAbu Yusuf, among the Hanafis, and al-Muzani among us, said: This means that they are equal, because the fact that one is mentioned after the other means that the ruling applies equally to both of them.\nEnd quote from Tashnif al-Masami`, 2/757.\nThe commentator Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe view that when two things are mentioned together they are subject to the same ruling is regarded as weak by most of the scholars of usul…\nBut some of the scholars regarded quoting that as evidence as being sound.\nEnd quote from Adwa’ al-Bayan, 3/266.\nBased on that, each phrase has its own ruling, depending on the context and other evidence.\nRegarding the phrase “trim your moustaches”, it was said that what is meant is to keep the moustache neat and clean, and it is more appropriate for that to be recommended, as is the case with using the siwak and putting on perfume before going to Jumu`ah prayer, and the like.\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi went too far when he said: In my view, the five characteristics mentioned in this hadith are all obligatory, and if a person neglects one of them, he will no longer look like a human, let alone look like a Muslim.\nHe said something similar in Sharh al-Muwatta’, and Abu Shamah commented on it by noting that the things that are required to make one look neat and clean do not need a command from the Lawgiver, because it is sufficient that one has a natural inclination to do them, so merely recommending them is enough.\nEnd quote from Fat-h al-Bari, 10/339-340.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/376756/is-trimming-the-moustache-sunnah-or-obligatory

Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted.).”\xa0(Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1425 and At-Tirmidhi, 464. Classed as sound by At-Tirmidhi and as authentic by Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr in Al-Istidhkar, 2/285 and An-Nawawi in Al-Adhkar, 86)\nIn Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (1100) it is narrated that the people, at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), used to pray against the disbelievers in the middle of Ramadan, (saying): “O Allah, destroy the disbelievers who seek to prevent people from following Your path and who disbelieve in Your Messengers and do not believe in the Day of Resurrection. Create disunity among them and instil fear in their hearts, and send Your wrath and punishment upon them, O God of truth.”\nThen he would send blessings on the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and pray for the Muslims for whatever he could of good, then he would pray for forgiveness for the believers. He said: And he used to say when he had finished praying against the disbelievers, sending blessings upon the Prophet, praying for forgiveness for the believing men and women and asking for good: “O Allah, You (alone) we worship and to You (alone) we pray and prostrate; for Your sake we strive and worship. We hope for Your mercy, our Lord, and we fear Your inevitable punishment, for Your punishment will surely befall the one whom You oppose.” Then he would say takbeer and fall down in prostration.\nAl-Albani said: “Its chain of narration is authentic.”\nFollowing the wording of Qunut of the Prophet\nPaying attention to the Du`a that was narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), then from his Companions after him, is better and is preferable and brings more blessings than making up flowery supplications and invented award, for which there is no guarantee that they will be free from mistakes in meaning or that they will not be contrary to proper etiquette when calling upon Allah, may He be exalted, and it will be more likely to keep one safe from showing off.\nAl-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted, has given us permission to call upon Him and has taught Du`a in His Book to His creation, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has taught his ummah how to offer Du`a. The Du`a of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is based on three things: proper knowledge of Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah), proper knowledge of the (Arabic) language and sincerity to the ummah. So no one should turn away from his Du`a (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).”\nAl-Mawardi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Hawi Al-Kabir (2/200): “What is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is what is more liked by us than anything else, but whatever a person says in Qunut of ‘Du`as narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and otherwise is good for that purpose.” (Both texts were quoted by Shaykh Muhammad Isma‘il Al-Muqaddim in his essay: ‘Udu ila khayr Al-Huda, pp. 45-46]\nIbn ‘Uqayl Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that ‘Du`as narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) should be what is recited as regular Wird, and anything added to it is by way of a concession. He said: “What is recommended in our view is that which was narrated by Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Allahumma ihdini…” – the well-known Hadith. He said: If one adds to that the words narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), “Allahumma inna nasta‘inuka… (O Allah, we seek Your help)…”, there is nothing wrong with that. (End quote the comments of Ibn Muflih on Al-Muharrar, 1/89)\nIndeed, some of the scholars spoke sternly about the issue of adding to the ‘Du`as narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him, to the extent that Al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd As-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said – as it says in his Fatawa, 87 –: “It is not appropriate to add anything to or subtract anything from what the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said in Qunut.” (End quote from ‘Udu ila Khayr Al-Huda, p. 45)\nRuling of adding to the wording of Qunut\nThere is nothing wrong with adding to the wording narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Qunut words that may be appropriate to the situation, because this is the issue of Du`a (supplication), and the issue of du a’ is broad in scope, and adding to it is something that is allowed in Islam. Concerning the Du`a narrated from ‘Umar, it says: … and he would pray for whatever he could of good for the Muslims, then he would pray for forgiveness for the believers.\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (3/477-478):\n“Shaykh Abu ‘Amr ibn As-Salah said: The view of those who say that one should limit Du`a in Qunut to that which is narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is odd and is not acceptable; it is contrary to the opinion of the majority of our companions and in fact is contrary to the opinion of the majority of scholars. Al-Qadi ‘Iyad narrated that the scholars unanimously agreed that there is no specific Du`a for Qunut…\xa0\xa0 The author of Al-Hawi said: It may be done reciting the Du`a narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or by saying other Du`as. (End quote)\nIt says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (34/63):\xa0“He may add whatever he wants of Du`as that are permissible to say during prayer.” (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (4/52):\n“If he adds to that, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is the matter of Du`a (supplication).” (End quote)\nDo not add to the wordings of Qunut as regular practice\nIt is important to note that although adding (phrases not narrated in the Sunnah) to a Du`a narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) is permissible according to the majority of scholars, it is not permissible to take that as a regular practice, thus neglecting the Sunnah and missing out on the blessing (barakah) of following the Sunnah as a result of that. Indeed, one should not always combine the two and regard them as being the same in status. Rather the worshipper should do that sometimes and not do it sometimes, according to the situation.\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“Undoubtedly dhikr and Du`as are among the best kinds of worship. Acts of worship are based on confirmed religious texts and adhering to the Sunnah, not on whims and desires and innovation. The Du`as and dhikrs narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are the best that anyone can find of dhikr and Du`a’, and the one who limits himself to them will be safe and sound. The beneficial results that they bring cannot be put into words or fully comprehended by man. Any other Dhikrs may be haram or they may be disliked. They may involve shirk which most people may not realise and which would take too long to explain in detail.\nNo one has the right to prescribe for people any kind of dhikr or Du`a that is not narrated in the Sunnah and make it an act of worship that people should perform regularly as they perform the five daily prayers regularly. Rather this is a kind of innovation in religion for which Allah has not given permission… As for adopting a Wird that is not prescribed in sharee’ah and dhikr that is not prescribed in sharee‘ah, this is something that is forbidden. Moreover the Du`as and Adhkar that are prescribed in sharee‘ah are the best and lead to achieving all aims and goals; no one turns away from them and adopts innovated and invented Adhkar except one who is ignorant, negligent or a wrong doer.” (End quote from Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/510- 511)\nHow long should Qunut be?\nHow long should Qunut be? Is it prescribed to make it lengthy or not?\nIf we study the Hadith of Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali quoted above, we will find that the Du`a that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) taught him is a brief and concise Du`a that only takes a few minutes. This indicates that what is appropriate in Du`a Al-Qunut is to make it brief and to stick to concise phrases.\nIt says in Mughni Al-Muhtaj, 1/369:\n“It says in Al-Majmu`, narrating from Al-Baghawi: It is disliked to make Qunut lengthy, like the first tashahhud. Al-Qadi Husayn said: If he makes Qunut longer than is usual, that is makruh.” (End quote)\nIn fact, an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) indicated that combining the Du`a of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Du`a of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) in Qunut comes under the heading of making it lengthy, and one should pay attention to the people’s circumstances and find out whether they approve of that.\nHe said: “Our companions said: It is recommended to combine the Qunut of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and that which is mentioned in the Hadith quoted above. If they are combined, then the more correct way is to recite the Qunut of ‘Umar second. And if he wants to keep it short, he should limit it to what is narrated in the Hadith. Rather it is recommended to combine the two if he is praying on his own or if he is an imam of people who approve of making it lengthy. And Allah knows best.” (Al-Majmu`, 3/478)\nIf combining the two Du`as mentioned, even though they are brief, is regarded as a kind of making it lengthy, then how about what is mentioned in your question of making it last for twenty minutes or thereabouts? What about those who offer Du`a for double that time or more, which many imams do who do not care about anything except giving a performance in front of people, Allah forbid? People have seen strange things of that nature nowadays.\nThe best approach in all of that – and Allah knows best – is to be moderate, for the best of affairs are those that are moderate; and Islam forbids making things difficult for people, especially if there is a custom of doing that every night.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question in Fatawa ‘Ulama’ Al-BaladAl-Haram (152):\nIn Ramadan, some of the imams in the mosques make the Du`a long, and some make it short. Which is the correct way?\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:\n“The correct way is not to exaggerate or to fall short. Making it so long that it causes hardship for the people is forbidden. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) heard that Mu‘adh ibn Jabal was making the prayer very lengthy when he led his people in prayer, he got angry in exhortation in an unprecedented manner, and he said to Mu‘adh ibn Jabal: “O Mu‘adh, do you want to put people off their religion?” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6106 and Muslim, 465)\nSo what should be done is adhering to the words narrated (in Hadith) or one may add more to that.\nUndoubtedly making it very lengthy causes hardship to people and exhausts them, especially the weak ones among them. Among the people are those who have work ahead of them but they do not like to leave before the imam, although it is difficult for them to stay with the imam. So my advice to my brother imams is to adopt a moderate approach. By the same token, they should refrain from offering Du`a on occasion, so that the common folk do not think that Du`a is obligatory.” (End quote)\nReciting Du`a Al-Qunut in a manner like reciting Quran\nWith regard to what you asked about reciting Du`a Al-Qunut (in a manner like reciting Qur’an) and beautifying the voice in it, if he exaggerates about that and is preoccupied with it and makes it his main concern, and he uses it as a means of attracting people’s attention to him, or he crosses the boundary between Du`a and exhortation or speaks as people ordinarily do, as in the case of the person referred to in your question, and as is done by many imams who toy with the people’s worship and emotions – if the situation is as described, then it is objectionable and is disapproved by everyone who knows the teachings of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and is rejected by everyone who has a sound nature.\nAl-Kamal ibn Al-Humam Al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when discussing the Mu’adhdhins who used to repeat the Takbir behind the Imam – in his time –\n“With regard to what you are accustomed to in this city, it is not unlikely that it is wrong, because it usually involves elongating the first syllable in the words “Allah” and “Akbar”, or the second syllable in the word “Akbar”, and that is wrong. Even if it does not involve that, they still raise their voices too much, more than is needed to convey the words, and they focus too much on their performance of tunes to show their proficiency in doing so, which has nothing to do with carrying out the act of worship properly.\nIt is obvious that the purpose behind this is to impress the people. It is as if he is saying: Look at my beautiful voice and how I come up with nice tunes, and that is wrong. I do not think that this would come from one who really understands the meaning of prayer and worship!\nIf this is what he said concerning the Mu’adhdhins, then what about the imams who do that in the prayer itself?! It is no wonder that he commented further and said:\nSimilarly, I think that coming up with nice tunes in Du`a, as some reciters do in our times, is not done by one who understands the real meaning of Du`a and asking of Allah. That is no more than a kind of playing about. If you saw someone making a request of a king and he put on this kind of performance, with his voice rising and falling as if singing, he would be accused of mockery and fooling about, because the appropriate way to ask is with beseeching and humility, not singing!” (End quote from Fat-h Al-Qadir by Kamal ibn Al-Humam, 2/225-226)\nWith regard to paying attention to making the voice beautiful, without exaggerating or pronouncing the letters differently from the correct Arabic pronunciation, it seems that this does not come under the heading of blameworthy singing referred to above.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about this and he replied in detail.\nHe (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question, as it says in Fatawa Al-Balad Al-Haram (153):\nSome imams of mosques try to soften people’s hearts and move them by changing the tone of voice sometimes during taraweeh prayer and in Du`a Al-Qunut, and I heard that some scholars disapprove of that. What is your opinion of that?\nHis reply was:\n“What I think is that if this is done within Shar`i limits, without exaggerating, then there is nothing wrong with it. Hence Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): If I had known that you were listening to my recitation, I would have beautified it for you.” If someone has a beautiful voice or recites in a way that softens people’s hearts, I do not think there is anything wrong with that. But exaggerating with regard to that so that he does this with every single word of the Qur’an, as mentioned in the question – I think that this is excessive and should not be done. And Allah knows best.” (End quote)\nReference: See [in Arabic] the essays Du`a Al-Qunut by Shaykh Bakr ibn ‘Abdullah Abu Zayd; `Udu ila Khayr Al-Huda by Shaykh Muhammad Isma`il Al-Muqaddim.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81083/how-long-should-qunut-be
132520,"What is your opinion on the operations that are carried out in Muslim countries and are aimed at killing foreigners, but they lead to the killing of numerous Muslims too, along with the destruction of buildings and infrastructure? Does this come under the heading of jihad, as those who carry out such operations claim?","['Praise be to Allah.Firstly:\nThese operations that are carried out in Muslim countries and are aimed at killing foreigners, as you say, are not jihad. Rather they come under the heading of spreading mischief, destruction and distorting the concept of jihad, and they are indicative of the ignorance and foolishness of those who carry them out. Those foreigners are granted safety in Muslim lands, and they only entered those lands with permission, so it is not permissible to transgress against them by beating and robbing them, let alone killing them. Their lives and wealth are protected, and the one who transgresses against them is in grave danger, as al-Bukhari, 3166, narrated from `Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills a mu`ahid [a non-Muslim who has a covenant with the Muslims] will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, even though its fragrance may be smelled from a distance of forty years.”\nThis includes the dhimmi [non-Muslim living under Muslim rule], the mu`ahid [a non-Muslim who has a covenant with the Muslims] and the musta’man [non-Muslim who has been granted safety by the Muslims].\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fat-h al-Bari: What is meant is one who has a covenant with the Muslims, whether it is on the basis of jizyah, a truce granted by a Muslim ruler, or one who has been granted safety by a Muslim. End quote.\nThe words “one who has been granted safety by a Muslim” refer to what is known to jurists, which is that it is not stipulated that safety should be granted by a ruler or sultan; rather it may be granted by any ordinary Muslim. The foreigners referred to enter the Muslim lands after being granted safety by the state, and also by a Muslim individual in many cases. Therefore it is not permissible to transgress against them, even if they come from a country that is at war with the Muslims.\nAl-Bukhari, 3171, and Muslim, 336, narrated that Umm Hani’ bint Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I went to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) during the year of the Conquest and I found him doing ghusl, and his daughter Fatimah was screening him with a cloth. I greeted him with salaam, and he said: “Who is this?” I said: Umm Hani’ bint Abi Talib. He said: “Welcome, Umm Hani’.” When he had finished his ghusl, he stood and prayed eight rak`ahs, wrapped in a single garment. Then I said: O Messenger of Allah, the son of my mother `Ali is saying that he will kill a man to whom I have granted safety, So-and-so the son of Hubayrah. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “We grant safety to the one to whom you have granted safety, O Umm Hani’.”\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever among us – whether a man or a woman or a slave – grants safety to one of them, that granting of safety is valid.\nTo sum up: if safety has been granted to some individuals whose people are at war with the Muslims, it is prohibited to kill them, take their wealth or transgress against them. Safety granted willingly by any adult Muslim of sound mind – male or female, free or slave – is valid. This was stated by ath-Thawri, al-Awza`i, ash-Shafa`i, Is-haq, Ibn al-Qasim and most of the scholars.\nEnd quote from al-Mughni, 9/195.\nSecondly:\nIf one who has been granted safety or has a covenant with the Muslims breaks that covenant, it is not permissible for any Muslim individual to kill him, because of the bad consequences that will result from that. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) refrained from killing `Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, the leader of the hypocrites, for fear that it would be said that Muhammad kills his companions. By the same token, it is not permissible for any individual Muslim to kill someone who apostatizes openly, whose life is no longer protected under Islamic law, for the reason that we have mentioned. How much evil and calamities such actions have brought upon the Muslims, and how much it has led to restrictions on efforts to call people to Islam and on the callers, and how often those with ulterior motives have used such incidents to distort the image of the truth and its followers.\nThirdly:\nWith regard to causing the death of Muslims whose lives are protected under Islamic law, this is a serious crime and grave sin, for “the destruction of the entire world is less grievous in the sight of Allah than the killing of a Muslim man,” as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said. Narrated by at-Tirmidhi, 1395; at-Tirmidhi, 3987 and Ibn Majah, 2619, from `Ubaydullah ibn ‘Amr. Classed as authentic by al-Albani in Sahih at-Tirmidhi.\nAs for these people’s claim that this is done in retaliation for the enemy using Muslims as human shields, this is to be rejected, and it is indicative of their ignorance and evildoing. We say that it is not permissible to kill a disbeliever whose life is not protected under Islamic law when he is alone [and is not using Muslims as human shields] because of the evil consequences that we mentioned above, so how about if, in addition to that, Muslims whose lives are protected under Islamic law are also killed?\nThus it becomes clear that the actions of these people are based on darkness upon darkness, and stem from ignorance, haste and a failure to consult the scholars, to whom we are enjoined to refer.

He was wrapped in his clothes as he was, and we were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3133; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. Al-Hafidh said in At-Talkhis, 2/118; its chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim)\nIt was narrated that Khabbab ibn Al-Aratt (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When Mus`ab ibn `Umayr was killed on the day of Uhud, he left nothing but one sheet. If we covered his head with it, his feet became exposed and if we covered his feet with it his head became exposed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us: “Cover his head with it and put Idhkhir (a kind of grass) over his feet.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4047 and Muslim, 940)\n\nScholarly Opinions: Recommended vs. Obligatory\nThe jurists differed concerning the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to bury martyrs in their clothes – is it recommended and better, or is it obligatory? There are two views:\n\nThe first view is that it is recommended. This is the view of the Shafi`is and some of the Hanbalis.\n\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (5/229): His heir has the choice: if he wishes he may bury him in what he is wearing, or if he wishes he may remove it and bury him in something else. But not doing that is preferable. (End quote)\nIbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (3/471): This is not definite, but it is preferable. The heir may remove his clothes and bury him in something else. (End quote)\nThey quoted as evidence that it is not obligatory the report narrated by Ahmad (1421) from Az-Zubayr which says that his mother Safiyyah (who was the sister of Hamzah) came with two garments on the day of Uhud and said: “These are two garments that I have brought for my brother Hamzah, for I have heard that he has been killed. Shroud him in them.”\nHe said: So we brought the two garments to shroud Hamzah\xa0 (may Allah be pleased with him) in them, and beside him there was a man of the Ansar who had been killed, and the same thing had been done to him as had been done to Hamzah.\nWe felt embarrassed to shroud Hamzah in two garments when the Ansari had no shroud, so we said: “One garment for Hamzah and one for the Ansari.” We measured them and one was bigger than the other, so we drew lots between them and we shrouded each of them in the garment that fit him. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Ahkam Al-Jana’iz, p. 62)\n\nThe second view is that the command is to be understood as meaning that it is obligatory. This is the view of the Malikis and Hanbalis, and was the view favoured by Ibn Al-Qayyim and Ash-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on them).\n\nAl-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (6/94): The correct view is that it is obligatory to bury him in the garments in which he was killed. (End quote)\nImam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If his heir wants to add to what he is wearing and he has something that will do as a shroud, he should not do that, even if that is available to him. Nothing should be added. (End quote from Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/294)\nAsh-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nayl Al-Awtar (4/50):\nIt seems that the command to bury the martyr in the clothes in which he was killed is to be understood as meaning that it is obligatory. (End quote)\nSpecial Circumstances for Shrouding Martyrs\nWith regard to the Hadith about Hamzah, they replied:\nHe was shrouded in another shroud because they (the non-Muslims) had mutilated him by cutting open his stomach and taking out his liver, and they had taken his clothes. That is why he was shrouded in another garment. This was stated by Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in Zad Al-Ma`ad, 3/217.\nIbn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person has been stripped by the enemy, there is no concession allowing him not to be shrouded, rather that is obligatory. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) shrouded two martyrs on the day of Uhud in one garment. (End quote from Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/294)\nIslamic Rulings on Removing Weapons and Accessories\nQuestion:\nShould whatever he has on him of weapons, furs, shoes, belts, caps, etc. be removed?\nWith regard to weapons, the scholars unanimously agreed that they should be removed.\nIbn Al-Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mudawwanah: his shield, sword and all weapons should be removed from him. (End quote from Mawahib Al-Jalil, 2/294)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (5/229): The scholars agreed that metal and leather should be removed from him. (End quote)\nIt seems that what is meant by “leather” is weapons and tools of war, because just one line above that, he mentioned that there is a difference of opinion with regard to removing furs and shoes. So what is meant by leather here is weapons, such as the scabbard in which the sword is worn, or the quiver in which arrows are kept, and the like.\nThey quoted the following as evidence for that:\n\nThe report narrated by Abu Dawud (3134) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that the metal and leather be removed from those who had been slain at Uhud, and that they should be buried with their blood and garments.” (This was classed as inauthentic by Al-Hafidh in At-Talkhees, 2/118; it was also classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Da`if Abu Dawud)\nBut there is no need to refer to this inauthentic Hadith, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (23144), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said on the day of Uhud: “Wrap them in their garments.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Talkhis Ahkam Al-Jana’iz, p. 36. Metal and leather (weapons) are not among one’s garments, so they are not included in this Hadith. (Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 2/368 and Al-Mughni, 3/471)\n\nWith regard to furs, shoes, caps and belts, the scholars differed as to whether they should be removed, and there are two views.\n\nThat they should not be removed. This is the view of the Malikis.\n\nAl-Hattab (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Mawahib Al-Jalil (2/294): Ibn Al-Qasim said: … nothing should be removed from one who is wearing anything, neither his clothes, nor furs, nor shoes, nor cap. Mutarrif said: nor his ring, unless it has a precious stone, nor his belt, unless it is valuable. (End quote)\nThey quoted as evidence the words of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the martyrs of Uhud: “Wrap them in their garments.”\xa0 This is general in meaning and includes all their garments.\n\nThat they may be removed. This is the view of the Hanafis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis.\n\nThey quoted as evidence the following:\n\nThe Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that the metal and leather be removed from those who had been slain at Uhud, and that they should be buried with their blood and garments. This is inauthentic, as stated above.\nThe report narrated from `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Furs, shoes and caps may be removed from the martyr. (This was classed as inauthentic by Ash-Shawkani in Nayl Al-Awtar, 4/50)\n\nAl-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Bada’i` As-Sana’i` (2/368-369): This is because what is left is left as a shroud, and the shroud is what is worn for covering the body, and these things are worn either for beautification and adornment, or for protection from cold, or for protection from weapons, and the deceased has no need for any of that, so none of these things can be a shroud. Thus it is clear that what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Shroud them in their garments” is the clothes in which they are shrouded and which are worn to cover the body.

240271,"After reading questions no. 216397 and 6333, can we say that the difference between the creation of `Isa (peace be upon him) and other humans is that Allah sent Jibril (peace be upon him) with the soul of `Isa (peace be upon him), whereas in the case of other humans, Allah sends an angel to breathe the souls into them after one hundred and twenty days? Is there any hadith which indicates the name of that angel? Are there any other differences between the creation of `Isa (peace be upon him) and that of other humans?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, appointed a noble angel to create `Isa from his mother; that angel appeared to her in human form.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Jibril], and We made her and her son a sign for all people}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:91]\n{And [the example of] Mary, the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [ruhina]}\xa0[At-Tahrim 66:12].\nThis angel was Jibril (peace be upon him), as is indicated by the context of the verses and as is indicated by the description of him as a ruh [spirit; translated here as angel] and as a messenger [rasul], and the fact that the word ruh is mentioned in conjunction with the Lord of Glory [ruhina – Our spirit/angel].\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Recount [O Muhammad] in the Book the story of Maryam, when she withdrew from her family in a place towards the east.\nShe screened herself from them, then We sent to her Our Angel [Jibreel], and he appeared before her in the form of a perfect human being.\nShe said: I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you; [do not come near me] if you fear Him!\nHe said: I am only a Messenger from your Lord, [to announce] to you the gift of a righteous son.\nShe said: How will I have a son when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste?\nHe said: Thus it will be. Your Lord says: That is easy for Me; We will make him a sign to humankind, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already decreed}\xa0[Maryam 19:16-21].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words {She screened herself from them} mean: She concealed herself from them and secluded herself. Then Allah, may He be exalted, sent Jibril (peace be upon him) to her, and he appeared to her in perfect human form.\nMujahid, ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj, Wahb ibn Munabbih and as-Suddi said regarding the words {then We sent to her Our Angel}: This refers to Jibril (peace be upon him).\nWhat they said is the apparent meaning of the Quran, as Allah, may He be exalted, said elsewhere:\n{The faithful Spirit [Jibreel] has brought it down\nto your heart so that you may be one of the warners}\n[Ash-Shu`ara 26:193-194].\n(End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/219-220)\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, created His Prophet `Isa (peace be upon him) in this manner, in a way that was different from the way in which other people are created, by way of highlighting to people the might, will and choice of the Creator, and that He, may He be blessed and exalted, creates whatever He wills and chooses, and no one can put back His decree.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says:\n{The likeness of `Isa before Allah is as the likeness of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, ‘Be!’ and he was}\xa0[Al `Imran 3:59].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says {The likeness of `Isa before Allah}, meaning in terms of His power, as He created him without a father, {is as the likeness of Adam}, for Allah, may He be exalted, created Adam without a father or a mother; rather He created him from dust, then He said to him, ‘Be!’ and he was. It is more appropriate to say that the One Who created Adam is able to create `Isa. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 2/49)\nIbn Kathir (may Allah be pleased with him) also said:\n{She said: How will I have a son when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste?} In other words, Maryam was astonished by that and said: How will I have a son? meaning: in what way will this son be born from me, when I have no husband and it cannot be imagined that I would commit immoral deeds? Hence she said: {when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste [baghi]}. The word baghi, translated here as unchaste, refers to a woman who fornicates.\n{He said: Thus it will be. Your Lord says: That is easy for Me} – that is, the angel said to her, in response to her question: Allah has said that He will create a child from you, even though you do not have a husband and you do not commit immoral actions, for He is able to do whatever He wills. Hence He said: {We will make him a sign to humankind} that is, proof and evidence to the people of the might of their Maker and Creator, Who creates them in different ways. He created their father Adam without any male or female, He created Hawwa’ from a male without a female, and He created all others from male and female, except for `Isa, whom He brought into existence from a female without a male. Thus there are four ways of creating, which are indicative of the perfect power and great might of Allah, besides Whom there is no god worthy of worship and there is no Lord except Him.\nThe words {and a mercy from Us} mean: We will make this boy a mercy from Allah, one of the prophets who call people to worship Allah, may He be exalted, alone and affirm His oneness… (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/220)\nSee also the answer to question no. 6333.\nTo sum up, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, created `Isa (peace be upon him) from a mother without a father. He gave the task of breathing his soul into his mother to a noble angel and trustworthy messenger, namely Jibril (peace be upon him), whom Allah, may He glorified and exalted, called Ruh al-Qudus (the Holy Spirit).\nAs for other humans, they are created from the meeting between the waters of the man and woman. Then if it be Allah’s will to create a child, fertilization occurs, and the soul is breathed into the embryo after one hundred and twenty days, according to the majority of jurists.\nAl-Bukhari, 3208, and Muslim, 2643, narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) , who is the most truthful one, told us: “The creation of any one of you is put together in his mother’s womb for forty days, then he becomes a ‘alaqah (a clinging clot) for a similar period, then he becomes like a lump of flesh (mudghah) for a similar period, then Allah sends to him an angel who breathes the soul into him and is enjoined to write down four things: his provision, his lifespan, his deeds and whether he is doomed (to Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise).”\nSo the forming and shaping of the embryo, the writing down of what is decreed for him, and the breathing of the soul into him are done by the angel who is appointed to do that, by the command of Allah, may He be exalted.\nThis angel, Jibril (peace be upon him), is the one who was appointed to breathe the soul of `Isa (peace be upon him) into his mother Maryam, by the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, according to the scholarly view regarding the matter that is most likely to be correct.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the Messiah, it was said that Maryam gave birth to him, and he is called al-Masih ibn Maryam (the Messiah son of Maryam), so the Messiah is part of Maryam, and he was created after his soul was breathed into the womb of Maryam, as Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{And [there is another example] in Maryam, the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded her chastity. We blew into her [garment] through Our angel}\xa0[At-Tahrim 66:12]\n{And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Jibril], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds\n{And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Jibril], and We made her and her son a sign for all people}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:91].\nWith regard to Hawwa’, Allah created her from a substance that was taken from Adam, just as He created Adam from an earthly substance, namely water, dust and wind which dried out until it became dry clay. Hence it cannot be said that Adam begat Hawwa’, or that Adam was begotten from dust, but it may be said of the Messiah that Maryam begat `Isa; thus he came from two sources: from Maryam and from the breath that Jibril breathed into her. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{then We sent to her Our Angel [Jibreel], and he appeared before her in the form of a perfect human being.\nShe said: I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you; [do not come near me] if you fear Him!\nHe said: I am only a Messenger from your Lord, [to announce] to you the gift of a righteous son.\nShe said: How will I have a son when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste?\nHe said: Thus it will be. Your Lord says: That is easy for Me; We will make him a sign to humankind, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already decreed.\nSo she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place}\xa0[Maryam 19:17-22].\nShe only conceived him after the soul was breathed into her, so it cannot be said that she carried him [the embryo] without a soul, then the living soul was breathed into him, like other humans. Hence there is a difference between the breathing in of the soul that led to pregnancy and the breathing in of the soul that signals the beginning of life. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 5/271; see also: 5/266)\nShaykh as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir, p. 530:\nWhen Jibril came to her in human form, in the shape of a perfect, handsome man, {She said: I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you; [do not come near me] if you fear Him!}. Then Allah rewarded her with a reward that matched her deed, and He blessed her with a son without a father; rather Jibril (peace be upon him) breathed into her and she conceived, by Allah’s leave. (End quote)\nHe also said on p. 874:\n{And [there is another example] in Maryam, the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded her chastity} that is, she protected herself and refrained from immoral actions, because of her perfect religious commitment, chastity and dignity.\n{We blew into her [garment] through Our angel}, meaning that Jibril (peace be upon him) blew into the neckline of her chemise, and his breath reached Maryam, and from her came `Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), the noble Messenger and great leader. (End quote)\nSee also: Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 18/204) and Adwa’ al-Bayan, 3/449.\nThe scholars differed as to how long Maryam was pregnant with `Isa (peace be upon him).\nThe majority are of the view that the pregnancy lasted nine months, as is the case with other humans.\n`Ikrimah said that it lasted for eight months, and he said: Hence no child born at eight months’ gestation will survive, so as to protect the unique character of `Isa.\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: No sooner did she become pregnant but she gave birth.\nThe view that is most likely to be correct is that she carried him as all women carry their children [i.e., the pregnancy lasted nine months].\nSee also the answer to question no. 45820.\nWith regard to the angel who is appointed to breathe the soul into the foetus, we have not come across any religious text that clearly states his name. Researching and asking about that is doing something that is not required, and there is no benefit to be gained from finding out what his name is.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/240271/what-is-the-difference-between-the-creation-of-isa-peace-be-upon-him-and-that-of-other-humans
113548,"My friend is having chemotherapy, and her hair has fallen out. Now she has a special occasion to attend, and she wants to attend it and wear a wig. Is it permissible to wear a wig in these circumstances?","['Praise be to Allah.The Islamic Ruling on Wearing Wigs\nWearing a wig comes under the heading of attaching hair, which is forbidden, and the one who does that is cursed, as Al-Bukhari (5477) narrated from Mu`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan (may Allah be pleased with him), that he took hold of a piece of hair that one of his guards was holding and said, as he was on the pulpit: Where are your scholars? I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbidding this kind of thing and saying: “The Children of Israel were only doomed when their women started to use such things.”\nAnd it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed the woman who adds false hair and the woman who has this done, and the woman who tattoos and the women who has them done.”\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\nWhat is the ruling on a woman wearing a wig to beautify herself for her husband?\nThey replied:\nBoth husband and wife should make themselves attractive to one another, in ways that the other likes, so as to strengthen their relationship, but this has to be within the limits of what is allowed in Shari`ah, not by doing things that are prohibited.\nThe use of wigs started among non-Muslim women, who were so well known for wearing them and adorning themselves with them that this became one of their distinguishing features. If a woman wears a wig and adorns herself with it, even if she does this for her husband, she is imitating the non-Muslim women, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”\nWigs also come under the ruling about hair extensions, which is even more vehement in its prohibition: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade this practice and cursed the one who does it. (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 5/191)\nWhen is a Wig Permissible?\nIt is permissible for a woman whose hair has fallen out to seek treatment, even if that is by having hair transplants, because this is not changing the creation of Allah; rather it is treatment to restore what Allah, may He be Exalted, had created.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, during its eighteenth session which was held in Malaysia 24-29 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1428 AH (9-14 July 2007 CE), regarding cosmetic surgery, and explaining what types of cosmetic surgery are permissible:\nRectifying accidental defects such as scars caused by burns, accidents, illness and otherwise, such as transplanting and patching skin; reconstructing breasts if they have been removed fully or partially; adjusting the size of the breasts if they are so large or so small that it will could lead to health problems; and hair transplants in the case of hair loss, especially for women. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who had taken medicine that caused loss of the hair on her head, or most of it, and she did not want to use a wig because she believed it to be prohibited.\nHe replied:\nWith regard to using a wig in a case such as that which you have described, where the woman’s hair has fallen out in a case in which there is no hope of it growing back, we say that in such cases there is nothing wrong with wearing a wig, because in fact it is not done to enhance beauty; rather it is done to remove a defect.\nBased on that, it does not come under the heading of adding artificial hair or hair extensions, for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it. He cursed the one who attaches something to the hair and the one who asks for that to be done, and that refers to one who attaches something to her hair, but this woman in fact cannot be likened to the one who attaches something to her hair, because she does not want to enhance beauty or attached anything to her hair that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, created for her. Rather she wants to remove a defect that has arisen, and there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the heading of removing a defect, not enhancing beauty. There is a difference between the two matters.

103623,"Some Brothers of mine are growing their beards but they are shaving their moustaches. They are saying that Omar, may Allah be pleased with him, did this and so it is good to do it. I read some answers on your website regarding the trimming of the moustaches, but it is permissible to shave it.","['Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the recommended Sunnah regarding the moustache, and there are two views:\n\nThe first view is that it is Sunnah to shave off the moustache altogether. This is the view of the Hanafis and Hanbalis. They quoted as evidence the apparent meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that were narrated concerning this, such as “Trim the moustache” [Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5892 and Muslim, 259] and other similar reports in Al-Bukhari and Muslim.\n\nAt-Tahawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Ma`ani Al-Athar (4/230):\nShaving the moustache is better than trimming. This is the view of Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad (may Allah have mercy on them). (End quote)\nIbn `Abidin (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Radd Al-Muhtar (2/550) that later scholars preferred to trim it and said:\nThe (Hanafi) view according to some later scholars among our Shaykhs is that the moustache should be trimmed. It says in Al-Bada’i`: This is the correct view. (End quote)\n\nThe second view is that the Sunnah is to trim the moustache, and that shaving it is disliked. This is the view of the Malikis and Shafi`is. Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was very strict concerning that.\n\nThey quoted the following as evidence:\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The Fitrah is five things: circumcision, shaving the pubes, trimming the moustache, trimming the nails and plucking the armpit hairs.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari,\xa0 5891 and Muslim, 257)\nIt was narrated that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “My moustache grew too long and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) trimmed it for me on a Siwak.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 188; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)\n\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (1/151) with his chain of narration that `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah Al-Uwaysi said: Malik ibn Anas mentioned that some people shave their moustaches, and he said: The one who does that should be beaten. The Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the moustache does not speak of shaving, rather it should be trimmed just enough to let the edge of the lips and the mouth show.\nMalik ibn Anas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Shaving the moustache is a Bid`ah (innovation) that has appeared among the people. (End quote)\nAbul-Walid Al-Baji (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Muntaqa Sharh Al-Muwatta` (7/266):\nIbn `Abd Al-Hakam narrated from Malik: Trimming the moustache does not mean shaving it. I think that the one who shaves his moustache should be disciplined. Ashhab ibn Malik narrated: Shaving it is a Bid`ah (innovation).\nMalik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It was narrated from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that when he was upset by something, he would twist his moustache. If it was shaved off, there would be nothing to twist. (End quote from At-Tamhid, 21/62-68).\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (1/34-341):\nThe guideline on trimming the moustache is that it should be trimmed so that the edge of the lip can be seen, but it should not be shaved off completely. This is our view. End quote.\nIn Nihayat Al-Muhtaj by Ar-Ramli (8/148), who is one of the Shafi`i Imams, it says: It is disliked to shave the moustache. (End quote)\nThis opinion was also narrated from a number of the Salaf.\nAl-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in As-Sunan Al-Kubra (1/151) with his chain of narrators that Shurahbil ibn Muslim Al-Khawlani said: I saw five of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) trimming their moustaches and letting their beards grow and dyeing them with saffron: Abu Umamah Al-Bahili, `Abdullah ibn Bisr, `Utbah ibn `Abd Al-Sulami, Al-Hajjaj ibn `Amir Ath-Thamali and Al-Miqdam ibn Ma`di Yakrib Al-Kindi. They used to trim their moustaches to the edge of the lip.\nThey responded to the evidence quoted in favour of the first view in two ways:\n\nWhat is meant by trimming is trimming the edge of the hair which grows over the lip, not shaving off the hair completely, based on the evidence of the reports which mention trimming only.\n\nAbul-Walid Al-Baji (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Muntaqa Sharh Al-Muwatta` (7/266):\nIbn Al-Qasim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from Malik that the explanation of the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about trimming the moustache is that it is to be trimmed enough to let the red part of the lips show and the edges of the mouth. (End quote)\nAn-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (1/340):\nThese reports – i.e. the reports which speak of trimming the moustache – are understood by us to mean trimming it to the edge of the lips, not shaving it off completely. End quote.\n\nTrimming does not mean removing it altogether, rather it means removing part of it.\n\nThe more correct view – and Allah knows best – is the second one, which is that the Sunnah is to trim the moustache and not to shave it.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (11/Bab Al-Siwak wa Sunan Al-Fitrah/question no. 54):\nThe best is to trim the moustache as is the Sunnah. As for shaving it, that is not Sunnah. The analogy drawn by some scholars, that it is prescribed to shave it as the head is shaved in Hajj is an analogy when a clear text states something else, so this analogy does not carry any weight. Hence Malik said concerning shaving the moustache: It is an innovation that has appeared among the people, but we should not turn away from what is mentioned in the Sunnah, because following it is guidance, righteousness, happiness and success. (End quote)\nThe Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: In a number of Hadiths it says “trim the moustache”. Is shaving different from trimming? Some people trim the first part of the moustache that is closest to the upper lip, and they leave the hair of the moustache, so they trim nearly half of the moustache and leave the rest. Is this what is meant? Or does trimming the moustache mean shaving off all of it? Please advise me of the manner in which the moustache should be trimmed.\nThey replied:\nThe authentic Hadiths from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicate that it is prescribed to trim the moustache. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the Mushrikin.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nAnd he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the Magians,” and in some versions it says: “Trim the moustache.” Trimming means cutting it very short. The one who cuts his moustache very short so that the upper lip is visible or trims it is not to blame, because the Hadiths mention two things, but it is not permissible to leave the edges of the moustache, rather the whole moustache should be trimmed or cut, in accordance with the Sunnah.

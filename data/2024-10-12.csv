340807,"What is the bliss that the people of al-Firdaws will enjoy, to the exclusion of the people in the other levels of Paradise? I do not mean what kind of people will enter it; rather I mean bliss in terms of rivers, palaces, al-hur al-iyn and so on, and their seeing the blessed Countenance of Allah. How does this type of bliss differ from that of the other levels?","['Praise be to Allah.Al-Firdaws is one of the names of Paradise\nOne of the names of Paradise is al-Firdaws. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Those are the inheritors\nWho will inherit al-Firdaws. They will abide therein eternally}\xa0[al-Mu’minun 23:10-11]\n{Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds – they will have the Gardens of Paradise [jannat al-firdaws] as a lodging as a dwelling place}\xa0[al-Kahf 18:107].\nAl-Firdaws is a name given to all of Paradise, and it was said that it is a name given to the best and loftiest part of it, as if that part is more deserving of this name than the rest of Paradise. (End quote from Hadi al-Arwah, 99)\nSecondly:\nAl-Firdaws is the highest of the levels of Paradise\nAt-Tirmidhi, 2450, narrated, and classed the report as sound, that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is worried about reaching his destination on time will set out at night, and the one who sets out at night will reach his destination. Indeed what Allah is offering is precious; indeed what Allah is offering is Paradise.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic in Sahih at-Tirmidhi and elsewhere.\nParadise is a precious thing, and al-Firdaws is the loftiest and best part of it. No one will reach it except those on whom Allah chooses to bestow additional blessing and grace.\nAt-Tirmidhi, 2450, narrated, and classed the report as authentic, from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Firdaws is the elevated part of Paradise, the middle of it and the best part of it.” Al-Albani classed it as authentic.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Paradise is surrounded with hardships and Hell is surrounded with desires.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)\nIf Paradise is surrounded with hardships and all kinds of difficulties, then how about the highest and most sublime part of it?\nThis indicates that reaching it is no easy matter.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe most sublime thing in existence, the purest, most luminous, noblest, highest in elevation and in esteem, and the vastest is the Throne of the Most Gracious, may He be glorified and exalted. Hence it was fit for Him to rise above it, and the closer anything is to the Throne, the more luminous, sublime and noble it is than that which is further away from it. Hence Jannat al-Firdaws is the highest part of Paradise, the noblest, most luminous and greatest part of it, because of its proximity to the Throne, for the Throne is its roof.\nThe further away a thing is from the Throne, the darker and more constricted it is. Hence the lowest level of Hell is the worst of places, the most constricted and the furthest away from all that is good. (End quote from al-Fawa’id, p. 27)\nThe people of al-Firdaws al-A`la will be the forerunners, those who hasten to do good deeds as they are commanded. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{And the foremost are the foremost;\nit is they who will be brought near to Allah,\nin gardens of delight }\xa0[al-Waqi`ah 56:10-12].\nAs-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Those who are brought near to Allah are the elite of creation. (End quote from Tafsir as-Sa`di, p. 833).\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThose who are foremost in doing good in this world will, in the hereafter, be foremost in honour, for the reward will match the deed, and a person will reap what he sows. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 7/517)\nAl-Firdaws is the highest of the levels of Paradise; we ask Allah of His grace and bounty.\nSee also the answers to questions no. 135085 and 27075.\nThirdly:\nThe people of Paradise will vary in status and level\nIn the Quran, Allah, may He be exalted, has mentioned different types of people in several places, and has described in detail the bliss of those who go ahead of others. Those places include what is mentioned in Surat ar-Rahman, Surat al-Waqi`ah and other surahs of the Holy Quran.\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told us about the variations in the level and status of the people of Paradise. It was narrated from Abu Sa`id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will see the people of the chambers above them as you see a brilliant star far away on the horizon in the east or the west, because of the difference in status between them.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, is that the status of the prophets that no one else will attain? He said: “No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul. They are men who believed in Allah and believed in the Messengers.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3256, and Muslim, 2831)\nIt was narrated that al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah told the people from the minbar –attributing it to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – “Moosa asked his Lord: ‘Who will be the lowest of the people of Paradise in status?’ He said: ‘He will be a man who will come after the people of Paradise have been admitted to Paradise and it will be said to him: “Enter Paradise.” He will say: “O Lord, how, when the people have taken their places and have received that with which they have been honoured?” It will be said to him: “Would it please you if you had the like of what one of the kings of the world had?” He will say: “I would be pleased, O Lord.” He will say, “You will have that, and as much again, and as much again, and as much again, and as much again.” The fifth time, he will say, “I am pleased, O Lord.” He will say: “You will have that and ten times as much, and you will have what your heart desires and what will delight your eyes.” He will say: “I am pleased, O Lord.”’ (Moosa) said: ‘My Lord, who will be the highest of them in status?’ He said, ‘They will be the ones whom I have chosen; I have guaranteed their honour and reward Myself and set a seal over it, and no eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has it entered the heart of man.’” He said: And the confirmation thereof is in the Book of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted: {No soul knows what is kept hidden in store for them of delight} [al-Sajdah 32:17].\n(Narrated by Muslim, 189)\nThe people of the highest level will enjoy bliss that is more sublime than that of those below them. Allah has stated that He has prepared for those who fear Him two gardens: {For him who fears standing before his Lord there will be two gardens} [ar-Rahman 55:46]. He describes them, then He says: {And below them both are two [other] gardens} [ar-Rahman 55:62 –that is, they will be lower than the first two gardens in status. The one who reflects on the characteristics of the second pair of gardens that Allah mentions will realize that they are lower than the first two in status, so the first two are for those who are close to Allah, and the others are for the people of the right (as-hab al-yamin).\nSee: al-Jannah wa’n-Nar by `Umar al-Ashqar, 158.\nWe have not come across any details of what Allah has prepared for the people of al-Firdaws of eternal bliss therein, other than what we already know, which is that it is the highest level of the people of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the Most Gracious, may He be glorified and exalted.\nIt is soundly narrated in the hadith from `Ubadah ibn as-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are one hundred levels. The distance between each two levels is like the distance between heaven and earth. Al-Fidaws is the highest of these levels; from it spring the four rivers of Paradise and above it is the Throne. So when you ask of Allah, ask Him for al-Firdaws.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 22738, and at-Tirmidhi, 2531. Al-Albani classed it as authentic)\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/340807/how-will-the-bliss-of-al-firdaws-al-ala-differ-from-that-of-the-other-levels-of-paradise
71359,Which surah of Al-Quran when recited is equal to reciting 1/2 Al-Quran?,"['Praise be to Allah.Analyzing Hadiths about the Virtue of Surat Az-Zalzalah\nThere are many Hadiths which speak of the virtue of certain Surahs of the Quran, some of which are authentic, but many of them are inauthentic. That includes the Hadith which speaks of the virtue of Surat Az-Zalzalah and says that it is equivalent to half of the Quran. A number of Munkar (inauthentic) Hadiths were narrated concerning that. They are as follows:\nExamining the First Hadith\n\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “ `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ (i.e., Surat Az-Zalzalah) is equivalent to half of the Quran.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2894 and Al-Hakim, 1/754)\n\nIts chain of narration includes Yaman ibn Al-Mughirah Al-`Anzi, concerning whom Al-Bukhari and Abu Hatim said: his Hadith is Munkar. Ibn Hibban said: his Hadith is very Munkar; he narrates Munkar Hadiths that have no basis and deserve to be ignored. (Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, 4/452)\nYaman is the only one who narrated this Hadith, alone among the companions of `Ata’, and he is not acceptable as a sole narrator of a Hadith, rather the fact that he is the sole narrator indicates that it is Munkar. And Allah knows best.\nThe majority of scholars are of the view that the Hadith is to be regarded as weak because of Yaman ibn Al-Mughirah, in contrast to those scholars who classed it as authentic. It was classed as inauthentic by At-Tirmidhi when he said, after quoting it: it is Gharib and we know it only from the Hadith of Yaman ibn Al-Mughirah. It was also classed as such by Ibn `Abd Al-Barr in At-Tamhid, where he said: It is one of the Hadiths of the Shaykhs, not one of the Hadiths of the imams. And it was classed as inauthentic by Ibn Hajar in Fat-h Al-Bari (8/687), by Adh-Dhahabi in Talkhis Al-Mustadrak, by Al-Manawi in Fayd Al-Qadir (1/367) and by As-Shawkani in Al-Fat-h Ar-Rabbani (12/5930). Al-Albani said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1342): it is Munkar.\nExamining the Second Hadith\n\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’, it will be equivalent to half of the Quran for him.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2893)\n\nIts chain of narration includes Al-Hasan ibn Salim Al-`Ajali. Al-Mizzi said: He is a Shaykh who is unknown and recited only one Hadith. Al-`Aqili said: He is unknown with regard to transmitting Hadith. Ibn Hibban said: he narrates from trustworthy narrators things that do not sound right.\xa0(Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, 1/396)\nThe scholars unanimously agreed that this Hadith is also to be regarded as inauthentic. It was classed as inauthentic by At-Tirmidhi when he said, after quoting it: It is Gharib. Al-`Aqili said: It is not known, as stated in Tahdhib At-Tahdhib (1/396). It was also classed as inauthentic by Ibn Hibban in Al-Majruhin (1/279), and Al-Bayhaqi in Shu`ab Al-Iman (2/497). Adh-Dhahabi said in Mizan Al-I`tidal (1/523): it is Munkar. Al-Albani said likewise in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1342)\nExamining the Third Hadith\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ in one night, it will be equivalent to half of the Quran for him.” (Narrated by Ibn As-Sunni in `Aml Al-Yawm wal-Laylah, 691)\n\nShaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1342): It was narrated by Abu Umayah At-Tarsusi in Musnad Abu Hurayrah (2/195), but its chain of narration is very weak; it includes `Isa ibn Maymun Al-Madani, who was classed as inauthentic by a number of scholars. Abu Hatim and others said: His Hadith is to be rejected. (End quote)\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nata’ij Al-Afkar (3/268): Its chain of narration includes a narrator who is very weak. (End quote)\nFrom the above it is clear that there is no authentic report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about Surat Az-Zalzalah being equivalent to half of the Quran. But it seems that some of the imams of the Salaf followed this Hadith and, based on their own Ijtihad, stated that the important meanings that are contained in this Surah are equivalent to half of the principles that the Quran referred to.\nIt says in Musannaf `Abd Ar-Razzaq (3/372): It was narrated that Ma`mar said: I heard a man narrating that `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ is equivalent to half of the Quran.\nIt was narrated from Ja`far that Hisham ibn Muslim said: I heard Bakr ibn `Abdullah Al-Muzani say: ‘When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ is half of the Quran.\nAbu `Ubayd narrated a Mursal report from Al-Hasan Al-Basri: “ `When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ is equivalent to half of the Quran, and `By the (steeds) that run’ (Surat Al-`Adiyat) is equivalent to half of the Quran.”\xa0 (End quote from Al-Itqan by As-Suyuti, 2/413)\nIt was narrated that `Asim ibn Abu An-Nujud Al-Imam Al-Muqri’ (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt was said that whoever recites ‘When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ it is as if he has recited half of the Quran.\nIbn Hajar said in Nata’ij Al-Afkar (3/270): its men are trustworthy.\nAl-Manawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fayd Al-Qadir (1/367):\nBecause the greatest objective of the Quran is to explain the creation and the resurrection, and ‘When the earth is shaken with its (final) earthquake’ refers only to the resurrection, therefore it is equivalent to half of the Quran. This was referred to by Al-Qadi. \xa0(End quote)\nThis is the Ijtihad (the exertion of a Muslim jurist’S best intellectual effort to derive legal rulingsS from Islamic sources when clearcut texts are not available) of some of the Salaf, and it is not permissible to attribute it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It does not mean that it is equivalent to half of the Quran in terms of reward.\nFor more details, please see the following answers: 90186, 75894, 2241, 132386, 10538, 114281.\nAnd Allah knows best.']",https://islamqa.info/en/answers/71359/which-surah-is-equal-to-half-of-the-quran
240271,"After reading questions no. 216397 and 6333, can we say that the difference between the creation of `Isa (peace be upon him) and other humans is that Allah sent Jibril (peace be upon him) with the soul of `Isa (peace be upon him), whereas in the case of other humans, Allah sends an angel to breathe the souls into them after one hundred and twenty days? Is there any hadith which indicates the name of that angel? Are there any other differences between the creation of `Isa (peace be upon him) and that of other humans?","['Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, appointed a noble angel to create `Isa from his mother; that angel appeared to her in human form.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Jibril], and We made her and her son a sign for all people}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:91]\n{And [the example of] Mary, the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [ruhina]}\xa0[At-Tahrim 66:12].\nThis angel was Jibril (peace be upon him), as is indicated by the context of the verses and as is indicated by the description of him as a ruh [spirit; translated here as angel] and as a messenger [rasul], and the fact that the word ruh is mentioned in conjunction with the Lord of Glory [ruhina – Our spirit/angel].\nAllah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Recount [O Muhammad] in the Book the story of Maryam, when she withdrew from her family in a place towards the east.\nShe screened herself from them, then We sent to her Our Angel [Jibreel], and he appeared before her in the form of a perfect human being.\nShe said: I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you; [do not come near me] if you fear Him!\nHe said: I am only a Messenger from your Lord, [to announce] to you the gift of a righteous son.\nShe said: How will I have a son when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste?\nHe said: Thus it will be. Your Lord says: That is easy for Me; We will make him a sign to humankind, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already decreed}\xa0[Maryam 19:16-21].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe words {She screened herself from them} mean: She concealed herself from them and secluded herself. Then Allah, may He be exalted, sent Jibril (peace be upon him) to her, and he appeared to her in perfect human form.\nMujahid, ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ibn Jurayj, Wahb ibn Munabbih and as-Suddi said regarding the words {then We sent to her Our Angel}: This refers to Jibril (peace be upon him).\nWhat they said is the apparent meaning of the Quran, as Allah, may He be exalted, said elsewhere:\n{The faithful Spirit [Jibreel] has brought it down\nto your heart so that you may be one of the warners}\n[Ash-Shu`ara 26:193-194].\n(End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/219-220)\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, created His Prophet `Isa (peace be upon him) in this manner, in a way that was different from the way in which other people are created, by way of highlighting to people the might, will and choice of the Creator, and that He, may He be blessed and exalted, creates whatever He wills and chooses, and no one can put back His decree.\nAllah, may He be exalted, says:\n{The likeness of `Isa before Allah is as the likeness of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, ‘Be!’ and he was}\xa0[Al `Imran 3:59].\nIbn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAllah, may He be exalted, says {The likeness of `Isa before Allah}, meaning in terms of His power, as He created him without a father, {is as the likeness of Adam}, for Allah, may He be exalted, created Adam without a father or a mother; rather He created him from dust, then He said to him, ‘Be!’ and he was. It is more appropriate to say that the One Who created Adam is able to create `Isa. (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 2/49)\nIbn Kathir (may Allah be pleased with him) also said:\n{She said: How will I have a son when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste?} In other words, Maryam was astonished by that and said: How will I have a son? meaning: in what way will this son be born from me, when I have no husband and it cannot be imagined that I would commit immoral deeds? Hence she said: {when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste [baghi]}. The word baghi, translated here as unchaste, refers to a woman who fornicates.\n{He said: Thus it will be. Your Lord says: That is easy for Me} – that is, the angel said to her, in response to her question: Allah has said that He will create a child from you, even though you do not have a husband and you do not commit immoral actions, for He is able to do whatever He wills. Hence He said: {We will make him a sign to humankind} that is, proof and evidence to the people of the might of their Maker and Creator, Who creates them in different ways. He created their father Adam without any male or female, He created Hawwa’ from a male without a female, and He created all others from male and female, except for `Isa, whom He brought into existence from a female without a male. Thus there are four ways of creating, which are indicative of the perfect power and great might of Allah, besides Whom there is no god worthy of worship and there is no Lord except Him.\nThe words {and a mercy from Us} mean: We will make this boy a mercy from Allah, one of the prophets who call people to worship Allah, may He be exalted, alone and affirm His oneness… (End quote from Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/220)\nSee also the answer to question no. 6333.\nTo sum up, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, created `Isa (peace be upon him) from a mother without a father. He gave the task of breathing his soul into his mother to a noble angel and trustworthy messenger, namely Jibril (peace be upon him), whom Allah, may He glorified and exalted, called Ruh al-Qudus (the Holy Spirit).\nAs for other humans, they are created from the meeting between the waters of the man and woman. Then if it be Allah’s will to create a child, fertilization occurs, and the soul is breathed into the embryo after one hundred and twenty days, according to the majority of jurists.\nAl-Bukhari, 3208, and Muslim, 2643, narrated that Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) , who is the most truthful one, told us: “The creation of any one of you is put together in his mother’s womb for forty days, then he becomes a ‘alaqah (a clinging clot) for a similar period, then he becomes like a lump of flesh (mudghah) for a similar period, then Allah sends to him an angel who breathes the soul into him and is enjoined to write down four things: his provision, his lifespan, his deeds and whether he is doomed (to Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise).”\nSo the forming and shaping of the embryo, the writing down of what is decreed for him, and the breathing of the soul into him are done by the angel who is appointed to do that, by the command of Allah, may He be exalted.\nThis angel, Jibril (peace be upon him), is the one who was appointed to breathe the soul of `Isa (peace be upon him) into his mother Maryam, by the command of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, according to the scholarly view regarding the matter that is most likely to be correct.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nRegarding the Messiah, it was said that Maryam gave birth to him, and he is called al-Masih ibn Maryam (the Messiah son of Maryam), so the Messiah is part of Maryam, and he was created after his soul was breathed into the womb of Maryam, as Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{And [there is another example] in Maryam, the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded her chastity. We blew into her [garment] through Our angel}\xa0[At-Tahrim 66:12]\n{And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Jibril], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds\n{And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Jibril], and We made her and her son a sign for all people}\xa0[Al-Anbiya’ 21:91].\nWith regard to Hawwa’, Allah created her from a substance that was taken from Adam, just as He created Adam from an earthly substance, namely water, dust and wind which dried out until it became dry clay. Hence it cannot be said that Adam begat Hawwa’, or that Adam was begotten from dust, but it may be said of the Messiah that Maryam begat `Isa; thus he came from two sources: from Maryam and from the breath that Jibril breathed into her. Allah, may He be exalted, says:\n{then We sent to her Our Angel [Jibreel], and he appeared before her in the form of a perfect human being.\nShe said: I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you; [do not come near me] if you fear Him!\nHe said: I am only a Messenger from your Lord, [to announce] to you the gift of a righteous son.\nShe said: How will I have a son when no man has touched me, and I have never been unchaste?\nHe said: Thus it will be. Your Lord says: That is easy for Me; We will make him a sign to humankind, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already decreed.\nSo she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place}\xa0[Maryam 19:17-22].\nShe only conceived him after the soul was breathed into her, so it cannot be said that she carried him [the embryo] without a soul, then the living soul was breathed into him, like other humans. Hence there is a difference between the breathing in of the soul that led to pregnancy and the breathing in of the soul that signals the beginning of life. (End quote from Majmu` al-Fatawa, 5/271; see also: 5/266)\nShaykh as-Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir, p. 530:\nWhen Jibril came to her in human form, in the shape of a perfect, handsome man, {She said: I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you; [do not come near me] if you fear Him!}. Then Allah rewarded her with a reward that matched her deed, and He blessed her with a son without a father; rather Jibril (peace be upon him) breathed into her and she conceived, by Allah’s leave. (End quote)\nHe also said on p. 874:\n{And [there is another example] in Maryam, the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded her chastity} that is, she protected herself and refrained from immoral actions, because of her perfect religious commitment, chastity and dignity.\n{We blew into her [garment] through Our angel}, meaning that Jibril (peace be upon him) blew into the neckline of her chemise, and his breath reached Maryam, and from her came `Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), the noble Messenger and great leader. (End quote)\nSee also: Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 18/204) and Adwa’ al-Bayan, 3/449.\nThe scholars differed as to how long Maryam was pregnant with `Isa (peace be upon him).\nThe majority are of the view that the pregnancy lasted nine months, as is the case with other humans.\n`Ikrimah said that it lasted for eight months, and he said: Hence no child born at eight months’ gestation will survive, so as to protect the unique character of `Isa.\nIt was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: No sooner did she become pregnant but she gave birth.\nThe view that is most likely to be correct is that she carried him as all women carry their children [i.e., the pregnancy lasted nine months].\nSee also the answer to question no. 45820.\nWith regard to the angel who is appointed to breathe the soul into the foetus, we have not come across any religious text that clearly states his name.

113548,"My friend is having chemotherapy, and her hair has fallen out. Now she has a special occasion to attend, and she wants to attend it and wear a wig. Is it permissible to wear a wig in these circumstances?","['Praise be to Allah.The Islamic Ruling on Wearing Wigs\nWearing a wig comes under the heading of attaching hair, which is forbidden, and the one who does that is cursed, as Al-Bukhari (5477) narrated from Mu`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan (may Allah be pleased with him), that he took hold of a piece of hair that one of his guards was holding and said, as he was on the pulpit: Where are your scholars? I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbidding this kind of thing and saying: “The Children of Israel were only doomed when their women started to use such things.”\nAnd it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed the woman who adds false hair and the woman who has this done, and the woman who tattoos and the women who has them done.”\nThe scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked:\nWhat is the ruling on a woman wearing a wig to beautify herself for her husband?\nThey replied:\nBoth husband and wife should make themselves attractive to one another, in ways that the other likes, so as to strengthen their relationship, but this has to be within the limits of what is allowed in Shari`ah, not by doing things that are prohibited.\nThe use of wigs started among non-Muslim women, who were so well known for wearing them and adorning themselves with them that this became one of their distinguishing features. If a woman wears a wig and adorns herself with it, even if she does this for her husband, she is imitating the non-Muslim women, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”\nWigs also come under the ruling about hair extensions, which is even more vehement in its prohibition: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade this practice and cursed the one who does it. (End quote from Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 5/191)\nWhen is a Wig Permissible?\nIt is permissible for a woman whose hair has fallen out to seek treatment, even if that is by having hair transplants, because this is not changing the creation of Allah; rather it is treatment to restore what Allah, may He be Exalted, had created.\nIt says in a statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, during its eighteenth session which was held in Malaysia 24-29 Jumada Al-Akhirah 1428 AH (9-14 July 2007 CE), regarding cosmetic surgery, and explaining what types of cosmetic surgery are permissible:\nRectifying accidental defects such as scars caused by burns, accidents, illness and otherwise, such as transplanting and patching skin; reconstructing breasts if they have been removed fully or partially; adjusting the size of the breasts if they are so large or so small that it will could lead to health problems; and hair transplants in the case of hair loss, especially for women. (End quote)\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who had taken medicine that caused loss of the hair on her head, or most of it, and she did not want to use a wig because she believed it to be prohibited.\nHe replied:\nWith regard to using a wig in a case such as that which you have described, where the woman’s hair has fallen out in a case in which there is no hope of it growing back, we say that in such cases there is nothing wrong with wearing a wig, because in fact it is not done to enhance beauty; rather it is done to remove a defect.\nBased on that, it does not come under the heading of adding artificial hair or hair extensions, for which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it. He cursed the one who attaches something to the hair and the one who asks for that to be done, and that refers to one who attaches something to her hair, but this woman in fact cannot be likened to the one who attaches something to her hair, because she does not want to enhance beauty or attached anything to her hair that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, created for her. Rather she wants to remove a defect that has arisen, and there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the heading of removing a defect, not enhancing beauty. There is a difference between the two matters.
